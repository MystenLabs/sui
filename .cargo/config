# Collection of project wide clippy lints. This is done via an alias because
# clippy doesn't currently allow for specifiying project-wide lints in a
# configuration file. This is a similar workaround to the ones presented here:

xtest = "run --package x --bin x -- external-crates-tests"

# Configuration specifically for running clippy on `external-crates/move/`.
# Some of these allows are to avoid code churn; others are filed as issues on the `sui` repo now.
