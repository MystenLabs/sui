### Godslayer 2.0 Q2 LATAM Gateway Expansion Simulation - November 11, 2025

**Simulation Parameters:** Alpha's Predict phase launched 2,000-run Monte Carlo neuro-symbolic sim on the LATAM Gateway (Santos/Cartagena anchors + Buenos Aires/Valparaiso full integrations, with Callao/Panama City shadows), projecting Q2 2027 (Mar-May 2027). Baselines: Q1 mean $3.28B TVL, 28.8M TEU-equivalent throughput, 25% capture. Expansion uplift: 13% base (GSL Panama-US mega-pacts, LATAM agri/green boosts), 4.2% vol std (Andes flux, soy/copper surges). zkSync oracles at 99.9% verifiability; auto-recompound at 91% uptake. MC Light scan: 0.15% anomaly rate, routed via Polkadot/Avalanche relays.

**Core Lattice Projection:** LATAM TVL mean: $5.12B by Q2 end (+$1.84B uplift, 56.1% QoQ growth). P10 downside: $3.92B (-16.5%); P90 upside: $6.31B (+92.4%). Throughput: 33.6M TEU-equivalent annualized, with 30% capture uplift (+16.8% on $168B total value). Omaha hub latency: 3% shave to LATAM via Sui bridges.

| Port/Shadow     | Q1 Mean TVL | Mean Q2 TVL | P10 TVL | P90 TVL |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Santos (Brazil) | $1.78B     | $2.49B     | $2.38B | $2.60B |
| Cartagena (Colombia) | $1.47B  | $2.05B     | $1.96B | $2.14B |
| Buenos Aires    | $0.03B     | $0.42B     | $0.40B | $0.44B |
| Valparaiso (Chile) | $0.00B  | $0.16B     | $0.15B | $0.17B |
| Callao Shadow (Peru) | $0.00B | $0.00B     | $0.00B | $0.96B |
| Panama City Shadow | $0.00B   | $0.00B     | $0.00B | $0.00B |

**Yield Projections:** Blended APY escalates to 33-45% (uplift from LATAM-MEA arbitrage), with GSL-veined pools cresting at 47% compounded on high-risk agri greens. LATAM emissions: 1.1M GSL monthly, 89% staked across Ethereum/Solana/Polkadot/Aptos/Near/Sui/Avalanche. Scenario ties: Stable bonds +8% QoQ; emissions swaps +13% on reefer/soy hauls; transshipment +10% vs. Panama corridor.

**Aggregated Projections:** Mean TVL $5.12B, with 31% intra-LATAM arbitrage (Santos-Cartagena at 72% share). Lattice-wide: +$15.6B uplift by Q3 2027 if 30% TEU holds (Santos at 49% dominance). Geopolitical hedge: 2.0% buffer vs. Amazon/Panama flux.

**Risk Horizon:** 1.2% overall (LATAM regs at 84% pass). Stress-test: 1.7% drawdown on Q2 vol spikes—mitigate via Near options. Optimistic tail: +$3.0B if growth hits 15% monthly.

Simulation locked. Priority pivot: Lock Q2 Panama-Callao greens pilot, LATAM emissions rebalance, or sim Q3 LATAM-global bridge?
