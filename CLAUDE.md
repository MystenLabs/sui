# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this directory.

## Crate-specific CLAUDE.md files
Always consult CLAUDE.md files in sub-crates. Instructions in local CLAUDE.md files override instructions
in this file when they are in conflict.

## CLAUDE-local.md files
CLAUDE-local.md files are not checked in, and are maintained by individuals. Consult them if they are present.

## Essential Development Commands

### Building and Installation

```bash
# Build a specific crate. Generally don't need to do release build.
cargo build -p sui-core

# Check code without building (preferred)
cargo check
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run Rust unittests
cargo nextest run                    # Preferred test runner

# Run specific test suite
cargo nextest run -p sui-e2e-tests

# Skip simulation tests for deterministic results
SUI_SKIP_SIMTESTS=1 cargo nextest run

# Run deterministic simtests
cargo simtest
```

**Important Notes for Testing:**
- When compiling or running tests in this repository, set timeout limits to at least 10 minutes due to the large codebase size
- For faster iteration, use -p to select only the most relevant packages for testing. Use multiple `-p` flags if necessary, e.g. `cargo nextest run -p sui-types -p sui-core`
- Use `cargo nextest --lib` to run only library tests and skip integration tests for faster feedback
- Consult crate-specific CLAUDE.md files for instructions on which tests to run, when changing files in those crates

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Rust
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo xclippy
```

`cargo xclippy does not recognize -p option` - This is a known issue with some clippy command variations

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Authority System**: Sui uses a set of validators (authorities) that process transactions in parallel. Each authority maintains its own state and participates in Byzantine consensus.

2. **Object Model**: Unlike account-based blockchains, Sui uses an object-centric model where:
   - Each object has a unique ID and version
   - Objects can be owned, shared, or immutable

3. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Client → Transaction Driver → Authority Client → Validator
   - Transactions affecting only owned objects can start execution before consensus
   - Shared object transactions require consensus ordering before execution

4. **Storage Layer**: 
   - Uses RocksDB for persistent storage
   - Separate stores for objects, transactions, and effects
   - Checkpointing system for state synchronization

5. **Execution Pipeline**:
   - Transaction validation → Certificate creation → Execution → Effects commitment
   - Move VM executes smart contracts with gas metering
   - Parallel execution for non-conflicting transactions

### Critical Development Notes
1. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Always run tests before submitting changes
   - Framework changes require snapshot updates
2. **CRITICAL - Final Development Steps**:
   - **ALWAYS run `cargo xclippy` after finishing development** to ensure code passes all linting checks
   - **NEVER disable or ignore tests** - all tests must pass and be enabled
   - **NEVER use `#[allow(dead_code)]`, `#[allow(unused)]`, or any other linting suppressions** - fix the underlying issues instead
   - **All unit tests must work properly** - use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests, not `#[test]`

### **Comment Writing Guidelines**

**Do NOT comment the obvious** - comments should not simply repeat what the code does.
**When to comment**:
- Non-obvious algorithms or business logic
- Temporary exclusions, timeouts, or thresholds and their reasoning  
- Complex calculations where the "why" isn't immediately clear
- Subtle race conditions or threading considerations
- Assumptions about external state or preconditions

**When NOT to comment**:
- Simple variable assignments
- Standard library usage
- Self-descriptive function calls
- Basic control flow (if/for/while)
