# Sui Code of Conduct

Sui as an open source project encourages free discussion rooted in respect.
We endeavor to always be mindful of others' perspectives and ask all
fellow contributors to do the same. We welcome you to the Sui platform
and ask you to help us grow it with relevant, on-point contributions.

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
