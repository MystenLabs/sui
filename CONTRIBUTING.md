# Contributing to This Project

Thanks for considering making a contribution to the Sui network or its documentation. Before you get started, please take a moment to read these guidelines.

## Important Note

We appreciate contributions, but **simple typo fixes (e.g., minor spelling errors, punctuation changes, or trivial rewording) will be ignored** unless they significantly improve clarity or fix a critical issue. If you are unsure whether your change is substantial enough, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.

# How to Contribute


## Documentation

Found a small error or typo in the main documentation? Each page on the [docs.sui.io](https://docs.sui.io/) site includes an **Edit this page** link at the bottom that you can use to edit the page in GitHub. The content is located in the docs/content directory of the Sui repo, so you can make a PR if you prefer. 

For larger documentation issues, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose) in GitHub. To fix the problem yourself, follow the [documentation contribution](./docs/content/references/contribute/contribution-process.mdx) guidelines.
