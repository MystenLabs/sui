- first check compile errors and propose recommended fixes
- ensure that the validity checks reject user transactions that attempt to use InputObjectMutability::NonExclusiveWrite
- transactional tests:
  - add new arg for trans test runner `nonexclusivewrite` which becomes a InputObjectMutability::NonExclusiveWrite
  - create test that creates a shared object and passes the object as a nonexclusivewrite arg.
    - it should be passed to a function that adds a dynamic field
    - run the test and capture the output snapshot
