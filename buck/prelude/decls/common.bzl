    Status: **experimental/unstable**.
     The deps query takes a query string that accepts the following query functions, and appends the
     output of the query to the declared deps:

     * `attrfilter`
    * `deps`
    * `except`
    * `intersect`
    * `filter`
    * `kind`
    * `set`
    * `union`


     The macro `$declared_deps` may be used anywhere a target literal pattern is expected
     in order to refer to the explicit deps of this rule as they appear in the rule's definition.
     For example, if your build rule declares

    ```

      android_library(
        name = 'lib',
        deps = ['//foo:foo'],
        deps_query = '$declared_deps',
      )
    ```

     then the macro `$declared_deps` would be expanded to a
     literal `set(//foo:foo)`.
     Some example queries:

    ```

      "filter({name_regex}, $declared_deps)".format(name_regex='//.*')
      "attrfilter(annotation_processors, com.foo.Processor, $declared_deps)"
      "deps('//foo:foo', 1)"
