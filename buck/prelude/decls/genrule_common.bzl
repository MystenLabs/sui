    The shell command to run to generate the output file. It is the
     fallback for `bash` and `cmd_exe` arguments. The following environment variables are populated by
     Buck and available to the shell command. They are accessed using
     the syntax:


    ```
    ${<variable>}
    ```


     Example:


    ```
    ${SRCS}
    ```

    `${SRCS}`


     A string expansion of the `srcs` argument delimited
     by the `environment_expansion_separator` argument
     where each element of `srcs` will be translated
     into an absolute path.


    `${SRCDIR}`


     The absolute path to a directory to which sources are copied
     prior to running the command.


    `${OUT}`


     The output file or directory for the `genrule()`.
     This variable will have whatever value is specified by
     the `out` argument if not using named outputs. If
     using named outputs, this variable will be the output directory.


     The value should be a valid filepath. The semantics of the shell
     command determine whether this filepath is treated as a file or a
     directory. If the filepath is a directory, then the shell command
     needs to create it if not using named outputs. Otherwise, it will
     be automatically created.


     The file or directory specified by this variable must always
     be written by this command. If not, the execution of this
     rule will be considered a failure, halting the build process.


    `${TMP}`


     A temporary directory which can be used for intermediate
     results and will not be bundled into the output.



    ##### String parameter macros

     It is also possible to expand references to other rules within the
     `cmd`, using builtin `string parameter macros`
    .
     All build rules expanded in the command are automatically considered
     to be dependencies of the `genrule()`.


     Note that the paths returned by these macros are *absolute* paths. You should convert these paths to be relative paths before
     embedding them in, for example, a shell script or batch file. Using
     relative paths ensures that your builds are *hermetic*, that
     is, they are reproducible across different machine environments.


     Additionally, if you embed these paths in a shell script, you should
     execute that script using the `sh\\_binary()`rule and include
     the targets for these paths in the `resources` argument of
     that `sh_binary` rule. These are the same targets that you
     pass to the string parameter macros.


    `$(classpath //path/to:target)`


     Expands to the transitive classpath of the specified build
     rule, provided that the rule has a Java classpath. If the rule
     does not have (or contribute to) a classpath, then an
     exception is thrown and the build breaks.


    `$(exe //path/to:target)`


     Expands a build rule that results in an executable to the
     commands necessary to run that executable. For example,
     a `java_binary()`  might expand to a call
     to `java -jar path/to/target.jar` . Files that are
     executable (perhaps generated by a `genrule()`)
     are also expanded. If the build rule does not generate an
     executable output, then an exception is thrown and the build
     breaks.


    `$(location //path/to:target)`


     Expands to the location of the output of the specified build
     rule. This means that you can refer to the output without
     needing to be aware of how Buck is storing data on the disk
     mid-build.


    `$(maven_coords //path/to:target)`


     Expands to the Maven coordinates for the specified build rule.
     This allows you to access the Maven coordinates for
     Maven-aware build rules. The format of the expansion is:

    ```
