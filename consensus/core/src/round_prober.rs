//! RoundProber periodically checks each peer for the latest rounds they received and accepted
//! from others. This provides insight into how effectively each authority's blocks are propagated
//! and accepted across the network.
//!
//! Unlike inferring accepted rounds from the DAG of each block, RoundProber has the benefit that
//! it remains active even when peers are not proposing. This makes it essential for determining
//! when to disable optimizations that improve DAG quality but may compromise liveness.
//!
//! RoundProber's data sources include the `highest_received_rounds` & `highest_accepted_rounds` tracked
//! by the CoreThreadDispatcher and DagState. The received rounds are updated after blocks are verified
//! but before checking for dependencies. This should make the values more indicative of how well authorities
//! propagate blocks, and less influenced by the quality of ancestors in the proposed blocks. The
//! accepted rounds are updated after checking for dependencies which should indicate the quality
//! of the proposed blocks including its ancestors.

/// A [`QuorumRound`] is a round range [low, high]. It is computed from
/// highest received or accepted rounds of an authority reported by all
/// authorities.
/// The bounds represent:
/// - the highest round lower or equal to rounds from a quorum (low)
/// - the lowest round higher or equal to rounds from a quorum (high)
///
/// [`QuorumRound`] is useful because:
/// - [low, high] range is BFT, always between the lowest and highest rounds
///   of honest validators, with < validity threshold of malicious stake.
/// - It provides signals about how well blocks from an authority propagates
///   in the network. If low bound for an authority is lower than its last
///   proposed round, the last proposed block has not propagated to a quorum.
///   If a new block is proposed from the authority, it will not get accepted
