/// A [`QuorumRound`] is a round range [low, high]. It is computed from
/// highest received or accepted rounds of an authority reported by all
/// authorities.
/// The bounds represent:
/// - the highest round lower or equal to rounds from a quorum (low)
/// - the lowest round higher or equal to rounds from a quorum (high)
///
/// [`QuorumRound`] is useful because:
/// - [low, high] range is BFT, always between the lowest and highest rounds
///   of honest validators, with < validity threshold of malicious stake.
/// - It provides signals about how well blocks from an authority propagates
///   in the network. If low bound for an authority is lower than its last
///   proposed round, the last proposed block has not propagated to a quorum.
///   If a new block is proposed from the authority, it will not get accepted
///   immediately by a quorum.
