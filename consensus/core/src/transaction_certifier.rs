/// TransactionCertifier has the following purposes:

///    later in core after acceptance of the blocks containing the transactions.
/// 3. Aggregates reject votes on transactions, and allows the aggregated votes
///    to be retrieved during post-commit finalization.
///
/// A transaction is certified if a quorum of authorities in the causal history of a proposed block
/// vote to accept the transaction. Accept votes are implicit in blocks: if a transaction is in
/// the causal history of a block and the block does not vote to reject it, the block
/// is considered to vote to accept the transaction. Transaction finalization are eventually resolved
/// post commit, by checking if there is a certification of the transaction in the causal history
/// of the leader. So only accept votes are only considered if they are in the causal history of own
/// proposed blocks.
///
/// A transaction is rejected if a quorum of authorities vote to reject it. When this happens, it is
/// guaranteed that no validator can observe a certification of the transaction, with <= f malicious
/// stake.
///
/// A block is certified if every transaction in the block is either certified or rejected.
/// TransactionCertifier outputs certified blocks.
///
/// The invariant between TransactionCertifier and post-commit finalization is that if a quorum of
/// authorities certified a transaction for fastpath and executed it, then the transaction
/// must also be finalized post consensus commit. The reverse is not true though, because
/// fastpath execution is only a latency optimization, and not required for correctness.
