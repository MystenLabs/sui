/// This module implements the Kiosk Extensions functionality. It allows
/// exposing previously protected (only-owner) methods to third-party apps.
///
/// A Kiosk Extension is a module that implements any functionality on top of
/// the `Kiosk` without discarding nor blocking the base. Given that `Kiosk`
/// itself is a trading primitive, most of the extensions are expected to be
/// related to trading. However, there's no limit to what can be built using the
/// `kiosk_extension` module, as it gives certain benefits such as using `Kiosk`
/// as the storage for any type of data / assets.
///
/// ### Flow:
/// - An extension can only be installed by the Kiosk Owner and requires an
/// authorization via the `KioskOwnerCap`.
/// - When installed, the extension is given a permission bitmap that allows it
/// to perform certain protected actions (eg `place`, `lock`). However, it is
/// possible to install an extension that does not have any permissions.
/// - Kiosk Owner can `disable` the extension at any time, which prevents it
/// from performing any protected actions. The storage is still available to the
/// extension until it is completely removed.
/// - A disabled extension can be `enable`d at any time giving the permissions
/// back to the extension.
/// - An extension permissions follow the all-or-nothing policy. Either all of
/// the requested permissions are granted or none of them (can't install).
///
/// ### Examples:
/// - An Auction extension can utilize the storage to store Auction-related data
/// while utilizing the same `Kiosk` object that the items are stored in.
/// - A Marketplace extension that implements custom events and fees for the
/// default trading functionality.
///
/// ### Notes:
/// - Trading functionality can utilize the `PurchaseCap` to build a custom
/// logic around the purchase flow. However, it should be carefully managed to
/// prevent asset locking.
/// - `kiosk_extension` is a friend module to `kiosk` and has access to its
/// internal functions (such as `place_internal` and `lock_internal` to
/// implement custom authorization scheme for `place` and `lock` respectively).
