/// - TransferPolicy - is a highly customizable primitive, which provides an
/// interface for the type owner to set custom transfer rules for every
/// deal performed in the `Kiosk` or a similar system that integrates with TP.
///
/// - Once a `TransferPolicy<T>` is created for and shared (or frozen), the
/// type `T` becomes tradable in `Kiosk`s. On every purchase operation, a
/// `TransferRequest` is created and needs to be confirmed by the `TransferPolicy`
/// hot potato or transaction will fail.
///
/// - Type owner (creator) can set any Rules as long as the ecosystem supports
/// them. All of the Rules need to be resolved within a single transaction (eg
/// pay royalty and pay fixed commission). Once required actions are performed,
/// the `TransferRequest` can be "confirmed" via `confirm_request` call.
///
/// - `TransferPolicy` aims to be the main interface for creators to control trades
/// of their types and collect profits if a fee is required on sales. Custom
/// policies can be removed at any moment, and the change will affect all instances
/// of the type at once.
