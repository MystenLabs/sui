// Tests objects on address, object, and owner.
//
// - The initial query for objects under address should yield no
//   objects.
// - After object creation, the same query for address.objects should
//   now have one object
// - A query for transactions belonging to an address that also
//   supplies an address filter will combine the two filters.
// - If the two filters suggest two different addresses, they will
//   combine to form an inconsistent query, which will yield no
//   results.
// - The same query on the address as an owner should return the same
//   result
// - The same query on the address as an object should return a null
//   result, since the address is not an object
