# GraphQL Schema Draft
# --------------------
#
# This is a draft design of the schema used by the second iteration of
# the RPC service.  Note that some elements may not be complete, and
# others may exist in this schema but may not appear in the production
# design initially, or ever.
#
# The source of truth for the actual schema is accessed by querying
# the GraphQL server for its `__schema`.

  # First four bytes of the network's genesis checkpoint digest

  # that can be tied to a particular checkpoint).
  availableRange: AvailableRange!

  # Configuration for this RPC service
  serviceConfig: ServiceConfig!

  # Simulate running a transaction to inspect its effects without
  # committing to them on-chain.
  #
  # `txBytes` either a `TransactionData` struct or a `TransactionKind`
  #     struct, BCS-encoded and then Base64-encoded.  The expected
  #     type is controlled by the presence or absence of `txMeta`: If
  #     present, `txBytes` is assumed to be a `TransactionKind`, if
  #     absent, then `TransactionData`.
  #
  # `txMeta` the data that is missing from a `TransactionKind` to make
  #     a `TransactionData` (sender address and gas information).  All
  #     its fields are nullable: `sender` defaults to `0x0`, if
  #     `gasObjects` is not present, or is an empty list, it is
  #     substituted with a mock Coin object, and `gasPrice` defaults to
  #     the reference gas price.
  #
  # `skipChecks` optional flag to disable the usual verification
  #     checks that prevent access to objects that are owned by
  #     addresses other than the sender, and calling non-public,
  #     non-entry functions.  Defaults to false.
  #
  # `epoch` the epoch to simulate executing the transaction in.
  #     Defaults to the current epoch.

# cursor `E`.  Then
#
#     query { eventsConnection(before: E, filter: F) }
#
# Will start paginating events up to the new data (multiple calls may
# be required if there are multiple pages of information between the
# start and the latest).  If the client has already processed some
# prefix, up to cursor `P`, then they can resume with:
#
#    query { eventsConnection(after: P, before: E, filter: F) }
