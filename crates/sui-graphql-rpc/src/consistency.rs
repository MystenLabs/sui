/// Constructs a `RawQuery` against the `objects_snapshot` and `objects_history` table to fetch
/// objects that satisfy some filtering criteria `filter_fn` within the provided checkpoint `range`.
/// The `objects_snapshot` table contains the latest versions of objects up to a checkpoint sequence
/// number, and `objects_history` captures changes after that, so a query to both tables is
/// necessary to handle these object states:
/// 1) In snapshot, not in history - occurs when an object gets snapshotted and then has not been
///    modified since
/// 2) In history, not in snapshot - occurs when a new object is created
/// 3) In snapshot and in history - occurs when an object is snapshotted and further modified
///
/// Additionally, even among objects that satisfy the filtering criteria, it is possible that there
/// is a yet more recent version of the object within the checkpoint range, such as when the owner
/// of an object changes. The `LEFT JOIN` against the `objects_history` table handles this and
/// scenario 3. Note that the implementation applies the `LEFT JOIN` to each inner query in
/// conjunction with the `page`'s cursor and limit. If this was instead done once at the end, the
/// query would be drastically inefficient as we would be dealing with a large number of rows from
/// `objects_snapshot`, and potentially `objects_history` as the checkpoint range grows. Instead,
/// the `LEFT JOIN` and limit applied on the inner queries work in conjunction to make the final
/// query noticeably more efficient. The former serves as a filter, and the latter reduces the
/// number of rows that the database needs to work with.
///
/// However, not all queries require this `LEFT JOIN`, such as when no filtering criteria is
/// specified, or if the filter is a lookup at a specific `object_id` and `object_version`. This is
/// controlled by the `view` parameter. If the `view` parameter is set to `Consistent`, this filter
/// is applied, otherwise if the `view` parameter is set to `Historical`, this filter is not
/// applied.
///
/// Finally, the two queries are merged together with `UNION ALL`. We use `UNION ALL` instead of
/// `UNION`; the latter incurs significant overhead as it additionally de-duplicates records from
/// both sources. This dedupe is unnecessary, since we have the fragment `SELECT DISTINCT ON
/// (object_id) ... ORDER BY object_id, object_version DESC`. This is also redundant for the most
/// part, due to the invariant that the `objects_history` captures changes that occur after
/// `objects_snapshot`, but it's a safeguard to handle any possible overlap during snapshot
/// creation.
