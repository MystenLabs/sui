//! # Consistent Store Indexer and RPC
//!
//! This crate defines a service that combines a [`sui_indexer_alt_framework`] indexer, with a gRPC
//! service serving queries about live data, consistent with some recent (measured in minutes or
//! hours) checkpoint.
//!
//! Supported queries include fetching objects by owner or by type, and fetching an address'
//! balance (across coin-like objects it owns).
//!
//! The service's indexer writes to a RocksDB database which it interacts through a `db`
//! abstraction, which exposes a type-safe abstraction over the underlying bytes-to-bytes ordered
//! map offered by [`rocksdb`].
//!
//! The database abstraction is also responsible for taking and exposing snapshots of the database,
//! which is what allows the RPC to serve a query at some checkpoint in the recent past. Snapshots
//! preserve access to the state of the database at a point in time, they are ephemeral (stored in
//! memory), and database-wide (not per-column-family).
//!
//! It is the `Indexer`'s responsibility to coordinate writes across pipelines, to arrange for the
//! database to contain a consistent view of the data at checkpoints it should take a snapshot of.
//! To this end, the indexer only supports sequential pipelines (pipelines also update keys
//! in-place, which precludes out-of-order writes), but writes are buffered, post-commit to allow
//! pipelines to make progress on later while checkpoints while waiting for lagging pipelines to
//! reach the snapshot checkpoint.
//!
//! The indexer and RPC agree on a `Schema` which describes the key types, value types and options
//! for all column families to be set-up in the database.
