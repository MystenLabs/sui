/// DB operation, and then how to write those rows atomically to the database.
///
/// The handler is also responsible for tuning the various parameters of the pipeline (provided as
/// associated values).
///
/// Sequential handlers can only be used in sequential pipelines, where checkpoint data is
/// processed out-of-order, but then gathered and written in order. If multiple checkpoints are
/// available, the pipeline will attempt to combine their writes taking advantage of batching to
/// avoid emitting redundant writes.
///
/// Back-pressure is handled by setting a high watermark on the ingestion service: The pipeline
/// notifies the ingestion service of the checkpoint it last successfully wrote to the database
/// for, and in turn the ingestion service will only run ahead by its buffer size. This guarantees
/// liveness and limits the amount of memory the pipeline can consume, by bounding the number of
/// checkpoints that can be received before the next checkpoint.

/// ready for insertion, and a committer which orders the rows and combines them into batches to
/// write to the database.

/// Commits are performed in checkpoint order, potentially involving multiple checkpoints at a
/// time. The call to [Handler::commit] and the associated watermark update are performed in a
/// transaction to ensure atomicity. Unlike in the case of concurrent pipelines, the data passed to
/// [Handler::commit] is not chunked up, so the handler must perform this step itself, if
/// necessary.
///
/// The pipeline can optionally be configured to lag behind the ingestion service by a fixed number
/// of checkpoints (configured by `checkpoint_lag`).

/// Watermarks are also shared with the ingestion service, which is guaranteed to bound the
/// checkpoint height it pre-fetches to some constant additive factor above the pipeline's
/// watermark.
///
/// Checkpoint data is fed into the pipeline through the `checkpoint_rx` channel, watermark updates
/// are communicated to the ingestion service through the `watermark_tx` channel and internal
/// channels are created to communicate between its various components. The pipeline can be
/// shutdown using its `cancel` token, and will also shutdown if any of its input or output
/// channels close, or any of its independent tasks fail.
