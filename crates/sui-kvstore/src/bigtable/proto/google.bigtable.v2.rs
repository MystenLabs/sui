///
/// There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
/// as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
/// (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
///
/// * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
/// from the output row. An example of a true filter is the `value_regex_filter`,
/// which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
/// regex true filters use RE2 syntax (<https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>)
/// in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
/// important point to keep in mind is that `RE2(.)` is equivalent by default to
/// `RE2(\[^\n\])`, meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to
/// match an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence `\C`,
/// which may need to be further escaped as `\\C` in your client language.
///
/// * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
/// cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
/// supported transformer is the `strip_value_transformer`, which replaces every
/// cell's value with the empty string.
///
/// * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
/// RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
///
/// The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
/// exceed 20480 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
/// (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.
