/// If a transaction digest shows up in this list, when executing such transaction,

/// criteria for adding a digest to this list:
/// 1. The certificate must be causing all validators to either panic or hang forever deterministically.
/// 2. If we ever ship a fix to make it no longer panic or hang when executing such transaction, we
///    must make sure the transaction is already in this list. Otherwise nodes running the newer
///    version without these transactions in the list will generate forked result.
///
/// Below is a scenario of when we need to use this list:
/// 1. We detect that a specific transaction is causing all validators to either panic or hang forever deterministically.
/// 2. We push a CertificateDenyConfig to deny such transaction to all validators asap.
/// 3. To make sure that all fullnodes are able to sync to the latest version, we need to add the
///    transaction digest to this list as well asap, and ship this binary to all fullnodes, so that
///    they can sync past this transaction.
/// 4. We then can start fixing the issue, and ship the fix to all nodes.
/// 5. Unfortunately, we can't remove the transaction digest from this list, because if we do so,
///    any future node that sync from genesis will fork on this transaction. We may be able to
///    remove it once we have stable snapshots and the binary has a minimum supported protocol
///    version past the epoch.
