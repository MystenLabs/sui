/// This test exists to make sure that the feature gating for all the code under `gas-profiler`
/// remains fully connected such that if and only if we enable the feature here, the `gas-profiler`
/// feature gets enabled anywhere.
///
/// If this test fails, check for the following.
///
/// Any crate that has code decorated with #[cfg(feature = "gas-profiler")] needs to have
/// a feature declared in its Cargo.toml named `gas-profiler`. If moving / refactoring code with
/// this decorator from a crate to a different crate, it is likely needed to copy over some of the
/// feature declaration defined in the original crate. Also ensure we do not include the feature in
/// any dependency of the dependencies section so that the feature won't get partially enabled as
/// default.
///
/// Each crate defines its own version of the feature with the same name. We can think of these
/// features as a tree structure where the root is defined here in this crate. Enabling the feature
/// here should continue to transitively enable all the other features in the other crates, and the
/// specific list of other crates' features that any given crate enables should include all features
/// defined in all the other crates that the decorated code in the current crate depends on.
///
/// Note this crate will always have the feature enabled in testing due to the addition of
/// `sui = { path = ".", features = ["gas-profiler"] }` to our dev-dependencies.
