[dependencies]

# For remote import, use the `{ git = "...", subdir = "...", rev = "..." }`.
# Revision can be a branch, a tag, and a commit hash.
# myremotepackage = { git = "https://some.remote/host.git", subdir = "remote/path", rev = "main" }

# For local dependencies use `local = path`. Path is relative to the package root
# local = { local = "../path/to" }

# To resolve a version conflict and force a specific version for dependency
# override use `override = true`
# override = { local = "../conflicting/version", override = true }

[addresses]
example = "0x0"
# Named addresses will be accessible in Move as `@name`. They're also exported:
# for example, `std = "0x1"` is exported by the Standard Library.
# alice = "0xA11CE"

[dev-dependencies]
# The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test` and
# `--dev` modes. You can introduce test-only dependencies here.
# local = { local = "../path/to/dev-build" }

[dev-addresses]
# The dev-addresses section allows overwriting named addresses for the `--test`
# and `--dev` modes.
