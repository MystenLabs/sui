Failed to publish the Move module(s), reason: [warning] Local dependency did not match its on-chain version at [[package address]]::dependency::dependency

This may indicate that the on-chain version(s) of your package's dependencies may behave differently than the source version(s) your package was built against.

Fix this by rebuilding your packages with source versions matching on-chain versions of dependencies, or ignore this warning by re-running with the --skip-dependency-verification flag.

=== publish dependency ===
[warning]: In a future release, dependency source code will no longer be verified by default during publication and upgrade. You can opt in to source verification using `--verify-deps` or disable this warning using `--skip-dependency-verification`. You can also manually verify dependencies using `sui client verify-source`.
BUILDING dependency
Successfully verified dependencies on-chain against source.
=== publish package v0 (should warn) ===
[warning]: In a future release, dependency source code will no longer be verified by default during publication and upgrade. You can opt in to source verification using `--verify-deps` or disable this warning using `--skip-dependency-verification`. You can also manually verify dependencies using `sui client verify-source`.
