We certify checkpoints 1-27

Checkpoint 28 is forked

why is checkpoint 28 forked?
We fix up all the others & apply overrides -
did we attempt to apply an override to 28?

what was the last checkpoint that we allowed rebuild?

We rebuilt 27 because 6-27 are forked and possible to recover

Checkpoint 27 is certified, meaning we reached quorum

2022-01-02T14:31:48.489631Z  INFO node{id=8 name="k#b3fd5efb.."}: sui_core::checkpoints: crates/sui-core/src/checkpoints/mod.rs:2405: Checkpoint certified (digest: CheckpointDigest(233Yx3LcDN89pjt71b8dC9CdmVxPsVzhhej9Khsf3iMS)) checkpoint_seq=27

Updated the test to include checkpoint_fork_dump in logs
