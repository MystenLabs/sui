title: SoWork x Sui
---

With a mission to move work from the Earth to the Cloud, [SoWork](https://sowork.com/) is building The Workplace Metaverse - the place where great teams ❤️ to work. SoWork has selected Sui as the underlying chain powering the various assets–such as land, items, and achievements–in the SoWork Metaverse.

 
## About SoWork

With thousands of companies working in SoWork’s Workplace Metaverse - including Tinder and teams at Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Netflix - SoWork is out to transform the way we look at teamwork, collaboration, and spending social time online. The shift to remote and distributed work has unveiled some serious problems in communication, teamwork, culture-building, productivity, and collaboration, on even the best teams. Perhaps surprisingly, many of these problems mirror issues that gamers have solved in order to work and bond together online for gaming (particularly in MMO-land). The SoWork team applies proven gaming principles to the business world to make remote, distributed, and hybrid work wonderful.

## SoWork on Sui

SoWork will start with launching two features on Sui:

**Employee Achievement NFTs:**
A system where companies can reward employees with NFT awards, based on customizable criteria with unlock-able perks. Awards can be merit-based, value-based, or events driven. In addition, leaders and teammates can purchase these NFTs and gift them to each other, further boosting teamwork and rapport.

In this system, awards are tied to each employee’s avatar, or identities. As awards are owned by each employee, they are able to freely display within their SoWork office, trade with each other, or list them in marketplaces.

**Minting NFTs via Mapmaker:**
Utilizing SoWork’s Mapmaker, creators can mint custom, mutable NFTs to import into their metaverse. Customs can include anything from clothing, decor, to furniture. Minting and import happens all at once, creating a seamless experience for the creator.

> “Sui is truly next-gen blockchain protocol technology. We’ve come a long way with Ethereum, but it really feels like Sui is what gets us as startups, consumers, and creatives to the next level of decentralization, because it goes beyond simple NFT minting.
>
>For SoWork specifically, we use Sui to deliver fast, efficient, cost-effective minting of composable, mutable NFTs to our customers, which just isn’t possible with older blockchain technology. One of our favorite use-cases is SoWork’s ‘Teammate Awards’ feature, which lets our workplace customers reward their employees in a fun, engaging manner via mutable NFTs.”

 
## Why This Matters

* Companies can utilize NFT to create unique and custom economies to drive better employee engagement, culture and incentives.
* Employees can receive and give unique rewards.
* Any creator can mint, quickly and cheaply, unique and mutable NFTs.
* Dynamic and composable NFTs mean there is no ceiling to their utility–these NFTs can grow and adapt new features.
