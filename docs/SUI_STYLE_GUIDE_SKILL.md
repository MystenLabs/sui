  Apply Sui Documentation style guide requirements to all documentation files. Do not edit code snippets within backticks.


  When revising existing documentation drafts, explicitly print what revisions were made in order to adhere to this style guide.


  When writing new documentation for source code, new features, or tooling, be sure to write the documentation for:

  * Audience: Broader developer audience. Do not over-define common developer terms like CLI, terminal, SDK, etc. Assume the reader is familiar with the idea of code development, but not necessarily Sui-specific code bases, tooling, or SDKs.

  * Consider AI ingestion: The documentation page will be ingested by agents and the docs.sui.io custom chatbot. Ensure the content is parseable for agents when exposed as markdown.

  * Consider character count: Finished pages should be under 50,000 characters. When writing new documentation pages, leave room for human revisions and additions.

# Sui Documentation Style Guide

**Critical:** Never edit code, code blocks, inline code, or anything in backticks. Leave all code lines as-is.

## Editorial Principles

- Use plain, direct language. Short sentences. Write for non-native English speakers.
- Do not redefine common words or use jargon/slang/idioms.
- Introduce technical terms only when necessary; define on first use, then use consistently.
- Be explicit: "Deploy the contract" not "do the thing."

## Spelling and Grammar

- **US English** spelling.
- **No Latin abbreviations** (no e.g., i.e., etc., et al.). Use "for example", "and so on", or "ex."
- **Active voice** always. Not passive.
- **Second person** ("you"). Never first ("I"/"we") or third person.
- **Present tense** always. No future tense for product behavior or instructions.
- **Oxford commas:** Always use serial commas.
- **Numbers:** Use numerals for counts (7 files, 24 items). Write out numbers only when grammatically part of the sentence ("One can always...").
- **No quotation marks** (exception: "Hello, World!").
- **No ampersands** in prose. Use "and".
- **No exclamation marks.**
- **No em dashes.** Rewrite using commas, parentheses, or split sentences.

### Punctuation Rules

- Period after complete sentences. Single space after periods.
- Lists: period if full sentence; no period if fragment. Don't mix.
- Parentheses: period inside if entire sentence is parenthetical; outside otherwise.
- No periods after headings/titles.
- Use parentheses sparingly for supplemental info. Avoid "(s)" for plurals — just use plural.

## Terminology and Vocabulary

### Always Capitalized
Proper nouns, product names, example app names (Coin Flip, Blackjack), Archival Store/Service, Coin Registry, Currency Standard, DeepBook Indexer, DeepBookV3, Devnet, GraphQL RPC, General-purpose Indexer, ID, Localnet, Kiosk (the standard), Mainnet, Mysticeti, One-Time Witness, Operation Cap, Sui, Sui CLI, Sui Client PTB CLI, Sui Closed-Loop Token / Closed-Loop Token, Sui dApp Kit, Sui Explorer, SuiJSON, Sui Keystore, Sui Keytool, SuiLink, Sui Object Display, SuiPlay0X1, SUI, SUI token, Testnet, Wallet Standard, Web2, Web3, zkSend SDK

### Always Lowercase
casual history, casual order, certificate, epoch, equivocation, eventual consistency, finality, gas, genesis, kiosk (instance), object, oracle, recovery passphrase (mnemonic), smart contract, soulbound, Sui framework, Sui object, total order, transaction, transfer, validator, wallet

### Never Hyphenated
key pair, layer 1, open source, use case

### Always Hyphenated
burn-only, depth-first search, multi-writer objects, off-chain, off-device, on-chain, on-device, One-Time Witness, peer-to-peer, proof-of-stake, single-writer objects

### Word Preferences
| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| may | might |
| "Please note" / "Note" at start of sentence | (remove or rewrite) |
| via | through |
| since (causal) | because |
| simple | basic |
| dApp | app |

### Nodes
- Lowercase "full node" for the conceptual role.
- Capitalize "Sui Full Node" for the official software binary.

### Product Names
- Product names are proper nouns. Capitalize all words. No "the" before product names.
- Specify wallet by name (Slush Wallet, Coinbase Wallet). Use "wallet" generically for the concept.

### Acronyms
- Spell out on first use with acronym in parentheses, then use acronym thereafter.
- Always use as acronyms: CLI, SDK.
- Do not abbreviate words (write "information" not "info").

## Capitalization

- **Page titles:** Title case. Do not capitalize short conjunctions/prepositions (a, an, and, but, for, in, or, so, to, with, yet) unless first/last word. Capitalize verbs including "Is" and "Be". Capitalize after hyphens. Match casing for commands/API elements.
- **Section headings, table cells, list items, captions, alt text, error messages:** Sentence case.
- **Body text:** Capitalize first word of sentences and proper nouns/product names. No ALL CAPS for emphasis (use bold). No bicapitalization unless brand (YouTube, DreamWorks). Don't capitalize spelled-out acronyms unless proper nouns.

## Body Text Styling

- **Bold:** Use for term:definition pairs (bold the term before the colon). Use sparingly for emphasis. Bold UI elements (buttons, menus, labels). Bold port references: **port 3000**.
- **Keyboard keys:** Use `<kbd>` tags: `<kbd>Enter</kbd>`.
- **No italic text.** Use the Glossary component for first-time term definitions.
- **No slashes** for "and"/"or". Write "True or False" or "True | False" in code docs.
- **Variables:** Uppercase with underscores for placeholders: `NETWORK_NAME`, `YOUR_API_KEY`. Keep consistent within a page.

## Titles and Headings

- Use descriptive titles (not just "Overview" or one-word titles). Prefer action-based titles ("Using Packages" not "Package Overview").
- Shorter titles for nav; use `sidebar_label` in frontmatter for different nav title.
- Section headings: sentence case. Never stack headings without body text between them.
- If something is inline code in body text, keep it as inline code in the heading.
- Do not reuse a page title as a heading on a different page.

### Heading Hierarchy
- `#` (H1): Page title only (set in frontmatter).
- `##` (H2): Top-level sections.
- `###` (H3): Sub-topics. Use for sections with 3+ lines of prose or complex explanations.
- `####` (H4): Short-form content, examples, bullet-point sections.
- `#####` (H5): Step headings in multi-procedure pages. Also usable for styled elements inside blockquotes.

## Lists

- Introduce lists with a description ending in a colon.
- Use lists instead of serial comma sentences with 4+ items.
- Sentence case (unless listing page titles in title case).

### Types
- **Numbered lists:** For sequences. Use `##step` component or H5 headings for steps.
- **Bulleted lists:** For related items. Periods only on full sentences.
- **Term lists:** Bold term, colon, definition. `- **Term:** Definition.`
- **Attribute lists:** Inline code for attribute name (not bolded), colon, description. `- \`id\`: Description.`

## Tables

- Bold labels in header row. Capitalize first word of heading. Follow body text style rules for cell content.

## Code

- **Inline code:** Backticks around object names, function names, file names with extensions, file extensions, CLI tool names, CLI commands in sentences, variable names, file paths. Apply in both body and headings.
- **Console commands:** Triple backticks, start with `$`. Keep commands and output in separate blocks.
- **Codeblocks:** Introduce with descriptive text including file placement context. Use triple backticks with language identifier and `title='filename.ext'`. Follow with explanation.
- **Source from GitHub** when possible using `<ImportContent>` component instead of copying inline.

### `<ImportContent>` Attributes
`source`, `mode` ("snippet" | "code"), `org`, `repo`, `ref`, `language`, `tag`, `fun`, `variable`, `struct`, `impl`, `type`, `trait`, `enumeration`, `module`, `component`, `dep`, `test`, `highlight`, `signatureOnly`, `noComments`, `noTests`, `noTitle`, `style`

## Procedures and Instructions

- Introduce procedures with an infinitive verb. Format as numbered/ordered lists.
- **Single procedure per page:** Use `##step` component.
- **Multiple procedures per page:** Use H5 headings for each step within each procedure.
- **Keyboard keys in procedures:** Uppercase, bold: Press **Enter**.
- **UI elements:** Bold, match exact text/capitalization. Omit special characters like ellipses from element labels.

## Prerequisites

### Sui Docs
```mdx
<Tabs className="tabsHeadingCentered--small">
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites">
- [x] Prerequisite one
- [x] Prerequisite two
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Walrus Docs
```mdx
<div className="outlined-tabs">
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites">
- [x] Prerequisite one
- [x] Prerequisite two
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>
```

## Links and References

- Use full relative links for docs.sui.io topics.
- Link text: use target topic title (title case) or descriptive sentence fragment. Never use a bare URL as link text.
- Use keywords from target topic title for inline links.
- Provide URLs only when reader needs to copy them (example code, config files).

## Special Components

### Collapsible (`<details><summary>`)
- Use for: large code snippets, verbose output, extended reference content.
- Do not use for: required procedure steps, short examples, critical content.
- Short descriptive summary, sentence case. Do not nest collapsibles.

### Alerts (Admonitions)
All alert content must be complete sentences, sentence case.
- **`:::caution`** — Risk of data loss, errors, or breaking changes. Explain the risk.
- **`:::danger`** — Critical/irreversible consequences (permanent data loss, security vulnerabilities).
- **`:::info`** — Important neutral context or conditions.
- **`:::note`** — Avoid; prefer `:::tip` or `:::info` instead.
- **`:::tip`** — Best practices, shortcuts, helpful advice.

## Images and Graphics

- Images supplement text, never replace it.
- Format: `.png` preferred, otherwise `.jpg`. Min 400px wide.
- Alt text describes what the image shows. Caption explains why it matters in context.
- Use Mermaid for flowcharts in Markdown.

## Index Pages

Every sidebar category with `link.type: 'doc'` must have a corresponding index page at all hierarchy levels.

Required format:
```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description.
keywords: [ keywords, here ]
pagination_prev: null
---

Brief intro sentence.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

## Accessibility

- No color or special symbols for emphasis. Use `<strong>` and `<em>`.
- Alt text + captions on all images describing content and context.
- Images never substitute for text content.
