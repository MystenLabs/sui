The Archival Store and Service provide a scalable and consistent foundation for accessing historical data on Sui, beyond what Full nodes or Indexer databases typically retain. They are designed to power rich developer experiences across [gRPC](./grpc-overview.mdx) and [GraphQL](./graphql-rpc.mdx) APIs while keeping storage and operational complexity manageable.

:::note

GraphQL RPC integration with the Archival Service will happen after the GraphQL RPC and General-purpose Indexer beta launch. Until then, the upcoming GraphQL RPC beta will only be available as a hosted service from the Sui Foundation, and will connect directly to the Archival Store (Bigtable) operated by the Sui Foundation.

## Overview

- The Archival Store is a long-term storage system (e.g., [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)) that holds checkpoint-indexed Sui data.
- The Archival Service is a [gRPC API (LedgerService)](./grpc-overview.mdx) layer that exposes access to this store, enabling point lookups of historical data.

Together, they help developers and data providers access older transactions, object versions, and checkpoints that Full nodes no longer retain.

## When and why to use

Both developers and RPC / data providers can benefit from the Archival Store and Service, though their goals and usage patterns differ.

### For application developers

- Access historical data for rendering UI features like transaction history, object lineage, and previous app states.
- Avoid infrastructure overhead by relying on hosted archival services for long-term data.
- Implement fallback mechanisms in apps such that they can query archival data if Full nodes or Indexer databases return insufficient retention.

### For RPC / data providers

- Operate a differentiated infrastructure service by offering historical data access to developers.
- Use the Archival Service to extend the retention horizon of GraphQL or gRPC-based APIs.
- Choose to run their own Archival Store and Service (using [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable) or custom backend) to maintain operational independence.

## Access options

### For developers

You can access the Archival Service hosted by any participating provider. Sui Foundation offers a public good service based on a [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)-based store, with strict rate limits:

- Testnet: 
- Mainnet:

### For RPC / data providers

You can operate the service and store yourself:

- Deploy the Archival Service binary.
- Maintain a store like [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable).
- Use a ingestion mechanism to populate the store with checkpoints.

Refer to [Populating the Archival Store](#populating-the-archival-store) and [Running the Archival Service](#running-the-archival-service).

## Populating the Archival Store

To keep the Archival Store updated, you must run an indexer pipeline. We provide an ingestion mechanism for [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable):

- Tool: [sui-kv-store](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-kvstore)
- To initialize the Bigtable cluster, run the following script:
```shell
$ ./crates/sui-kvstore/src/bigtable/init.sh <name_of_bigtable_cluster>
```
- Run the ingestion daemon with:
```shell
$ cargo run --bin sui-kvstore <name_of_your_bigtable_cluster> ingestion <mainnet|testnet>
```

If you're using a different storage backend:

- Build a compatible indexer using the [Custom Indexing Framework](./custom-indexing-framework.mdx).
- Ensure it emits data in a structure compatible with the [gRPC API's](./grpc-overview.mdx) `LedgerService`.

## Running the Archival Service

The Archival Service implements the [gRPC API's](./grpc-overview.mdx) `LedgerService`. Any implementation must support this interface.

- Reference implementation for Bigtable: [sui-kv-rpc](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-kv-rpc).
- The service can be deployed independently or colocated with other infrastructure.

## Integration points

### With gRPC APIs

- Apps can fall back to querying the Archival Service directly when gRPC on Full nodes return retention-related errors.
- This allows a graceful degradation model without requiring the app to maintain historical data.
- You can access the Archival Service just like you would access [gRPC `LedgerService` APIs](./grpc-overview.mdx) on a Full node, by replacing the URL with the endpoint of the Archival Service.

### With GraphQL RPC

- With a planned integration after the upcoming beta release, [GraphQL RPC](./graphql-rpc.mdx) would be able to delegate historical lookups to the Archival Service.
- This would enable cost-efficient setup of General-purpose Indexer database with limited retention.
