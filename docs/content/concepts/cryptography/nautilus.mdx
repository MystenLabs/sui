description: Run secure, off-chain logic in trusted execution environments (TEEs), and verify it on chain to trigger safe smart contract workflows.
---

Nautilus is a framework for secure and verifiable off chain computation on Sui. It enables builders to delegate sensitive or resource-intensive tasks to a self-managed [trusted execution environment (TEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) while preserving trust on chain through smart contract-based verification.

Nautilus is designed for hybrid decentralized applications (dApps) that require private data handling, complex computation, or integration with external (Web2) systems. It ensures that off-chain computations are tamper resistant, isolated, and cryptographically verifiable. 

It currently supports self-managed [AWS Nitro Enclave TEEs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/). Developers can verify AWS-signed enclave attestations on chain using Sui smart contracts written in Move. Refer to the [Github repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus) for the reproducible build template.

## Features

A Nautilus application consists of two components:

- Off-chain server: Runs inside a TEE, like AWS Nitro Enclaves, and performs the actual computation, such as processing user input or executing a scheduled task.
- On-chain smart contract: Written in Move, this contract receives the output and verifies the TEE's attestation before trusting or acting on the data.

:::info

Initial support for AWS Nitro Enclaves is due to its maturity and reproducibility. Additional TEE providers might become available in the future.

### How it works

- Deploy the off-chain server to a self-managed TEE, such as AWS Nitro Enclaves. You have the option of using the [available reproducible build template](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus).
- The TEE generates a cryptographic attestation that proves the integrity of the execution environment.
- Sui smart contracts verify the attestation on chain before accepting the TEE output.
- The integrity of the TEE is auditable and anchored by the providerâ€™s root of trust.

## Use cases

Nautilus supports several Web3 use cases for trustworthy and verifiable off-chain computation. Some examples include:

- **Trusted oracles:** Nautilus could ensure that oracles fetch and process off-chain data in a tamper-resistant manner before providing results to a smart contract. The source of external data could be a Web2 service (like weather, sports, betting, asset prices, and so on) or a decentralized storage platform like [Walrus](https://walrus.xyz).
- **AI agents:** Nautilus is ideal for securely running AI models for inference or to execute agentic workflows to produce actionable outcomes, while providing data and model provenance on chain.
- **DePIN solutions:** DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) can leverage Nautilus for private data computation in IoT and supply chain networks.
- **Fraud prevention in multi-party systems:** Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) could use Nautilus for order matching and settlement, or layer-2 solutions could prevent collision and fraud by securely running computations between untrusted parties.
- **Identity management:** Nautilus can provide solutions in the identity management space that require on-chain verifiability for decentralized governance and proof of tamper resistance.

When used together, Nautilus and [Seal](https://github.com/MystenLabs/seal) enable powerful privacy-preserving use cases by combining secure and verifiable computation with secure key access. A common challenge with TEEs is persisting secret keys across restarts and different machines. Seal can address this by securely storing long-term keys and granting access only to properly attested TEEs. In this model, Nautilus handles computation over the encrypted data, while Seal controls key access. Applications that require a shared encrypted state can use both tools to privately process user requests and update encrypted data on public networks.

## Future plans and non-goals

Nautilus will support additional TEE providers in the future, such as [Intel TDX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html) and [AMD SEV](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html) possibly. Your suggestions on which platforms to prioritize or support is greatly appreciated.

Nautilus does not have a native, readily usable TEE network. Nautilus partners might provide such TEE networks, however. Apart from such networks, you are encouraged to deploy and manage your own TEEs for running off-chain Nautilus servers.
