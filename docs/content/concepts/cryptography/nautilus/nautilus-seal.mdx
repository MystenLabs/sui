The Nautilus and [Seal](https://seal-docs.wal.app) integration pattern allows Nautilus enclaves to securely fetch public keys and identity-based decryption keys from Seal key servers. These keys can be used to encrypt or decrypt sensitive data directly inside the enclaves, ensuring that data is protected end-to-end, both at rest and in use.

This pattern is ideal for use cases that require confidential data handling, secure AI workflows, or fine-grained access control policies enforced cryptographically.

## What this enables

Use this pattern to:

* Decrypt sensitive data inside an enclave, without exposing secrets to the host.
* Encrypt new data with public keys from Seal key servers, ensuring only authorized enclaves can later decrypt it.
* Build trusted compute flows across secure storage (e.g., [Walrus](https://docs.wal.app)), on-chain objects (e.g., Sui), or other data sources.

The encrypted data can arrive at the enclave from any source, as long as it was encrypted under the corresponding Seal access policy.

## Why it matters

* End-to-end protection: Data is encrypted before reaching the enclave and decrypted only within a verified environment.
* No secrets on host: Decryption keys and ephemeral secrets stay inside the enclave.
* Flexible integration: Supports arbitrary payloads (e.g., credentials, AI models, gameplay states) from different input sources.
