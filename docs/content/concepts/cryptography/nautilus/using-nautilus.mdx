title: Using Nautilus
description: Details on how to use Nautilus using the provided reproducible build template.
---

The [Nautilus framework](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus) helps you deploy an AWS Nitro Enclave with all the necessary scaffolding, such as reproducible builds, signature formatting, and HTTPS traffic forwarding, so you can focus on implementing the off-chain computation logic inside the enclave.

In addition, the framework provides an on-chain template that includes the minimal smart contract code required to register a Nautilus instance and its public key. These are the steps you take to use Nautilus in your dApp:

1. Implement the enclave in Rust with the desired computation logic.
2. Deploy a Move smart contract that stores the expected platform configuration registers (PCRs) and allows updates by the contract deployer.
3. Deploy the enclave instance on AWS and register it on chain using its attestation document.
4. Upload signed responses from the registered enclave, verify them on chain, and consume the results in your smart contract.

## Purpose of this guide

This guide walks you through the following steps:

1. Writing and deploying a basic Nautilus off-chain instance using AWS Nitro Enclaves. The example instance runs a server that fetches weather data for a specific location.
2. Writing a Move smart contract that registers the enclave by verifying its attestation and public key, then verifies the Nautilus response (signature and payload) on chain and mints an NFT containing the location and temperature data.

The setup script performs the following actions:

- Launches a preconfigured EC2 instance and allocates a Nitro Enclave.
- Builds the Rust-based template application into an enclave image format (EIF) binary and runs it inside the enclave.
- Configures required HTTP domains so the enclave can access external APIs via the parent EC2 instance (as the enclave itself has no internet access).
- Exposes three endpoints to allow client-side communication with the enclave.

When the enclave starts, it generates a fresh enclave key pair and exposes the following three endpoints:

- `health_check`: Probes all allowed domains inside the enclave. This logic is built into the template and does not require modification.
- `get_attestation`: Returns a signed attestation document over the enclave public key. Use this during on-chain registration. This logic is built into the template and doesn't require modification.
- `process_data`: Fetches weather data from an external API, signs it with the enclave key, and returns the result. This logic is customizable and you must implement it.

## Code structure   

Refer to the [Github repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus) for the code structure and related usage instructions that follow.

```sh
/move
  /enclave          # Utility functions for generating enclave config and registering the public key with an attestation document.
  /weather-example  # Entry point for on-chain logic as an example, which uses enclave functions to run your Nautilus application logic.
  /twitter-example  # Entry point for onchain logic as another example, which uses enclave functions to run your Nautilus application logic. 

/src
  /aws              # AWS boilerplate; does not require modification.
  /init             # AWS boilerplate; does not require modification.
  /system           # AWS boilerplate; does not require modification.
  /nautilus-server  # Nautilus server that runs inside the enclave.
    /src
      /apps
        /weather-example    # Example directory. Replace with your own application logic as needed.
          mod.rs            # The process_data endpoints and related artifacts to fetch weather data. Replace this with your off-chain computation logic.
          allowed_endpoints.yaml  # This file lists all endpoints the enclave is allowed to access. By default, the enclave has no internet access unless the parent EC2 instance explicitly forwards traffic. During the configuration step, this file is used to generate the necessary code to enable limited traffic forwarding from the enclave. 
        /twitter-example    # Another example directory with similar parts as for above example. 
    run.sh           # Runs the Rust server inside the enclave after configuring domains and the traffic forwarder. Do not modify.
    common.rs        # Common code for retrieving attestation. Do not modify. 
```

Key implementation files:
- `allowed_endpoints.yaml`: Defines external API access permissions.
- `mod.rs`: Contains application-specific computation logic.
- `run.sh`: Handles server startup and configuration.
- `common.rs`: Manages retrieving attestation.

For the latest structure, always refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus).

To create your own Nautilus app:

- Add a new directory under `move/my_app` for your Move modules.
- Add a corresponding directory under `src/nautilus-server/src/apps/my_app` for your Rust server logic.
- Use the existing app directories as references.
- Build your frontend logic to interact with the deployed Move contract and enclave-hosted Rust server.
- The rest of the template can remain largely unmodified, streamlining development while giving you full control over app-specific logic.

Frontend code is not included in this guide. The Move call is demonstrated using the CLI.

## Run the example enclave

1. Set up an AWS developer account and install the AWS CLI. For detailed instructions, see the [AWS Nitro Enclaves getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/getting-started.html#launch-instance).

1. Run the following script and follow the prompts. The script prompts you to enter some values - see the next step if you want to run this example as is. If the script completes successfully, it generates code locally that you need to commit. If you encounter issues, refer to the info box that follows, as instructions might vary depending on your AWS account settings.

    ```sh
    $ export KEY_PAIR=<your-key-pair-name>
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
    $ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your-session-token>
    $ sh configure_enclave.sh <APP> # e.g. `sh configure_enclave.sh weather-example`
    ```

    :::info

    - Run `sh configure_enclave.sh -h` to view additional instructions.
    - If your AWS account is not in `us-east-1`, you might need to configure `REGION` and `AMI_ID` values specific to your region. Refer to this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html) to find a suitable Amazon Linux image ID. 

        ```sh
        $ export REGION=<your-region>
        $ export AMI_ID=<find-an-amazon-linux-ami-for-your-region>
        ```
    - To find the values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, refer to this [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-up.html).
    - Set `KEY_PAIR` to the name of your existing AWS key pair or one you create. To create a key pair, refer to this [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html).
    - You might need to create a vpc with a public subnet. Refer to this [AWS guide](https://000058.awsstudygroup.com/2-prerequiste/2.1-createec2/2.1.2-createpublicsubnet/) for instructions.

    :::

1. To run the weather example as is, you don't need to modify `allowed_endpoints.yaml` because it already includes `api.weatherapi.com`. Follow the prompts to enter the required values. This step demonstrates how to store a secret (an API key) using AWS Secrets Manager, so you can avoid including the secret in the public application code.

    ```sh
    Enter EC2 instance base name: weather # anything you like
    Do you want to use a secret? (y/n): y
    Do you want to create a new secret or use an existing secret ARN? (new/existing): new
    Enter secret name: weather-api-key # anything you like
    Enter secret value: 045a27812dbe456392913223221306 # this is an example api key, you can get your own at weatherapi.com
    ```
    For the Twitter example, this secret value refers to the API Bearer Token associated with your Twitter Developer account.

2. If completed successfully, changes are generated in `/src/nautilus-server/run.sh` and `expose_enclave.sh`. Commit these changes, as they are required when building the enclave image.

    :::info

    - To allow the enclave to access additional external domains, add them to `allowed_endpoints.yaml`. If you update this file, you must re-run `configure_enclave.sh` to generate a new instance, as the endpoint list is compiled into the enclave build.
    - You can optionally create a secret to store any sensitive value you donâ€™t want included in the codebase. The secret is passed to the enclave as an environment variable. You can verify newly created secrets or find existing ARNs in the [AWS Secrets Manager console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/listsecrets?region=<REGION>).

    :::

3. Connect to your instance and clone the repository. For detailed instructions, see [Connect to your Linux instance using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html#connect-linux-inst-sshClient) in the AWS documentation.

4. You should now be inside the directory containing the server code, including the committed file changes from the previous step. Next, build the enclave image, run it, and expose the HTTP endpoint on port 3000. 

    ```sh
    $ cd nautilus/
    $ make ENCLAVE_APP=<APP> && make run # this builds the enclave and runs it, e.g. `make ENCLAVE_APP=weather-example`
    $ sh expose_enclave.sh # this exposes port 3000 to the Internet for traffic
    ```

    :::info

    Use `make run-debug` instead of `make run` to run the enclave in debug mode. This prints all logs, where the production build does not. In debug mode, the PCR values are all zeros and are not valid for production use.

    :::

5. Congratulations! You can now interact with the enclave from the outside world. You can find the `PUBLIC_IP` in the AWS console.

    ```sh
    $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/health_check
    $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/get_attestation
    $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"payload": { "location": "San Francisco"}}' -X POST http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/process_data
    ```

6. Optionally, you can set up an application load balancer (ALB) for the EC2 instance with an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), and configure Amazon Route 53 for DNS routing. For more information, see the [ACM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) and the [ALB Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).

## Develop your own Nautilus server

The Nautilus server logic lives in `src/nautilus-server`. To customize the application, refer to `apps/weather-example` or `apps/twitter-example` as templates:

- Define `allowed_endpoints.yaml` to specify any external domains your application needs to access.
- Create `mod.rs` to define your `process_data` logic and register any additional endpoints.

The following files typically do not require modification:

- `common.rs` handles the `get_attestation` endpoint.
- `main.rs` initializes the ephemeral key pair and sets up the HTTP server.

You can test most functionality by running the server locally. However, the `get_attestation` endpoint doesn't work locally because it requires access to the Nitro Secure Module (NSM) driver, which is only available when running the code inside the configured EC2 instance. This endpoint functions correctly when the server runs within the enclave as described in the setup steps.

To test the `process_data` endpoint locally, run the following:

```sh
$ cd src/nautilus-server/
$ RUST_LOG=debug API_KEY=045a27812dbe456392913223221306 cargo run --features=weather-example --bin nautilus-server
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"payload": { "location": "San Francisco"}}' -X POST http://localhost:3000/process_data
```

}
```
</details>


### Troubleshooting

- **Traffic forwarder error:** Ensure all targeted domains are listed in the `allowed_endpoints.yaml`. Use the following command to test enclave connections to all domains.

```sh
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/health_check
```

    {
      "api.weatherapi.com":true
    }
}
```
</details>

- **Docker is not running:** The EC2 instance might still be starting up. Wait a few moments, then try again.

- **Cannot connect to enclave:** This might be due to a VSOCK communication issue. Verify that the enclave is running and properly exposed with `sh expose_enclave.sh`.

### Reset

```sh
$ cd nautilus/
$ sh reset_enclave.sh
```
Then repeat the image build step.

## Build locally to check reproducibility

Every enclave built from the same source code (everything in `/src`) can produce identical PCRs through reproducible builds. This includes any traffic forwarding changes made in `run.sh` (see branch `example-configuration`).

```sh
$ cd nautilus/
$ make ENCLAVE_APP=weather-example
$ cat out/nitro.pcrs
```

You can also view an [example enclave object](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/object/0x53db077721140910697668f9b2ee80fbecd104ac076d60fc1fb49ae57cd96c0d) that includes the registered enclave public key.

You can find the frontend code for the Twitter example [in this repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus-twitter/tree/main/frontend).

### Enclave management

The template allows the admin to register multiple `Enclave` objects associated with one `EnclaveConfig` that defines PCRs. Each `Enclave` object represents a specific enclave instance with a unique public key, while the `EnclaveConfig` tracks the PCR values and their associated version. You can register all new `Enclave` instances with the latest `config_version` to ensure consistency. 

This design allows the admin to run multiple instances of the same enclave with different public keys, where `config_version` is set to the latest version when creating an `Enclave` object. The admin can register or destroy their `Enclave` objects. 

### Update PCRs

The deployer of the smart contract holds the `EnclaveCap`, which allows for updating the PCRs and enclave public key if the Nautilus server code has been modified. You can retrieve the new PCRs using `make ENCLAVE_APP=<APP> && cat out/nitro.pcrs`. To update the PCRs or register the enclave again, reuse the steps outlined in the previous section.

## Using the verified computation in Move

You can now write your frontend code to interact with the enclave for computation, and then send the resulting data to the Move contract for use. For the weather example, you can request the enclave to retrieve weather data for a specific location:

```sh
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"payload": { "location": "San Francisco"}}' -X POST http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/process_data
```

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>
```json
{
  "response":
    {
      "intent":0,
      "timestamp_ms":1744683300000,
      "data":
        {
          "location":"San Francisco",
          "temperature":13
        }
    },
  "signature":"77b6d8be225440d00f3d6eb52e91076a8927cebfb520e58c19daf31ecf06b3798ec3d3ce9630a9eceee46d24f057794a60dd781657cb06d952269cfc5ae19500"
}
```
</details>

Then use the values from the enclave response - `signature`, `timestamp`, `location`, and `temperature` - to call `update_weather` in the Move contract. In this example, the call is demonstrated using a script, but it should be integrated into your dApp frontend.

```sh
$ sh ../../update_weather.sh \
    $APP_PACKAGE_ID \
    $MODULE_NAME \
    $OTW_NAME \
    $ENCLAVE_OBJECT_ID \
    "77b6d8be225440d00f3d6eb52e91076a8927cebfb520e58c19daf31ecf06b3798ec3d3ce9630a9eceee46d24f057794a60dd781657cb06d952269cfc5ae19500" \
    1744683300000 \
    "San Francisco" \
    13
```

Signing payloads in Move are constructed using Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS). These must match the structure specified in the enclaveâ€™s Rust code when generating the signature; otherwise, signature verification in `enclave.move` might fail.

Write unit tests in both Move and Rust to ensure consistency. See `test_serde()` in `src/nautilus-server/src/app.rs` and the examples in `move/enclave/enclave.move`.

## FAQs

Some questions the community often asks about are answered in the following sections.

### Why did Sui choose AWS Nitro Enclaves initially?

There are many TEE providers available, but initial support for AWS Nitro Enclaves is due to their maturity and support for reproducible builds. Support for additional TEE providers might be considered in the future.

### Where is the root of trust of AWS?

It is stored as part of the Sui framework and used to verify AWS attestation documents. You can verify its hash by following the steps outlined on [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/verify-root.html#validation-process).

```sh
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MystenLabs/sui/refs/heads/main/crates/sui-types/src/nitro_root_certificate.pem -o cert_sui.pem
$ sha256sum cert_sui.pem
