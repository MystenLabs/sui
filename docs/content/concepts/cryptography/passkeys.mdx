title: Passkeys
description: Passkeys is a Sui primitive that enables you to sign-in to apps and send transactions to Sui using a private key securely stored on a authenticator. It uses the WebAuthn standard.
---

Passkeys provide a secure and user-friendly alternative for submitting transactions to Sui. Built on the **WebAuthn standard**, passkeys let users authenticate and sign transactions using:

- Hardware security keys, such as YubiKeys)
- Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets
- Platform-based authenticators, such as Face ID and Touch ID

Passkeys simplify authentication by removing the need to manage seed phrases or private keys manually. Instead, they rely on device-based authentication and cloud synchronization, allowing seamless, phishing-resistant access across multiple devices.

By integrating passkeys, Sui improves security and accessibility, making it easier for users to manage their accounts without compromising decentralization or cryptographic security.

Refer to [Typescript SDK support](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/cryptography/passkey) on how to add passkey support to your application. Also feel free to refer to [SIP-9](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-9.md) for product specification.

Passkeys is available in beta in Sui Devnet and Testnet. The Mainnet release is yet to be scheduled.

## Benefits of using passkeys

**Sign transactions seamlessly**

Users can sign transactions in Sui using passkeys, where the passkey private key stays securely stored within the authenticator, reducing the risk of key extraction attacks.

**Authenticate across devices**

Users can approve transactions on their mobile phones by scanning a QR code from a desktop browser. Cloud-synchronized passkeys (such as those stored in Apple iCloud or Google Password Manager) let users authenticate across multiple devices without manual key transfers.

**Use hardware security keys**

Users can sign transactions with external security keys, such as YubiKeys, to add an extra layer of protection against phishing and unauthorized access.

**Authenticate with platform-based security**

Users can sign transactions directly on devices with built-in authenticators (such as Face ID on iPhones or Windows Hello on Windows PCs). This approach lets users sign transactions natively without needing an external security key.

**Recover access and secure accounts with multi-signature authentication**

Cloud-synced passkeys help users recover access if they lose a device.

## Limitations of passkeys

**Passkey functionality varies by authenticator**

Some security keys do not support biometric authentication, requiring users to enter a PIN instead. Also since WebAuthn does not provide access to private keys, users must store their passkeys securely or enable cloud synchronization for recovery.

**Cloud synchronization introduces potential risks**

Cloud-synced passkeys improve accessibility but also create risks if a cloud provider is compromised or if a user loses access to their cloud account. Users who prefer full self-custody can rely on hardware-based passkeys that do not use cloud synchronization.

**Passkeys cannot be exported**

Users cannot transfer passkeys between different authenticators. For example, a passkey created on a security key cannot move to another device unless it syncs through a cloud provider. To avoid losing access, users should set up authentication on multiple devices.

**Multisig support is not available yet**

Passkeys are not supported with [Multisig](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/multisig) yet, which could allow using Passkey with [ZkLogin](/concepts/cryptography/zklogin). Reach out to us if you are interested in such a support.
