title: Passkey
description: Sui supports the passkey signature scheme that enables you to sign-in to apps and sign transactions for Sui using a private key securely stored on a passkey authenticator. It uses the WebAuthn standard.
---

Passkey provides a secure and user-friendly alternative for submitting transactions to Sui. Built on the **WebAuthn standard**, passkey lets users authenticate and sign transactions using:

- Hardware security keys, such as YubiKeys
- Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets
- Platform-based authenticators, such as Face ID and Touch ID

Passkey simplifies authentication by removing the need to manage seed phrases or private keys manually. Instead, they rely on device-based authentication and cloud synchronization, allowing seamless, phishing-resistant access across multiple devices.

By supporting the passkey signature scheme, Sui improves security and accessibility, making it easier for users to manage their accounts with hardened security. Passkey-based wallets are also tied to the origin, meaning they canâ€™t be phished or used on a different site, which makes it a more secure authentication option.

Refer to the [Typescript SDK support](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/cryptography/passkey) on how to add passkey support to your application. For product specification, refer to [SIP-9](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-9.md).

:::info
Passkey support is available in beta in Sui Devnet and Testnet. The Mainnet release is yet to be scheduled.

## Benefits of using passkey

**Sign transactions seamlessly**

Users can sign transactions in Sui using passkey, where the passkey private key stays securely stored within the authenticator, reducing the risk of key extraction attacks.

**Authenticate across devices**

Users can approve transactions on their mobile phones by scanning a QR code from a desktop browser. Cloud-synchronized passkey (such as those stored in Apple iCloud or Google Password Manager) lets users authenticate across multiple devices without manual key transfers.

**Use hardware security keys**

Users can sign transactions with external security keys, such as YubiKeys, to add an extra layer of protection against phishing and unauthorized access.

**Authenticate with platform-based security**

Users can sign transactions directly on devices with built-in authenticators (such as Face ID on iPhones or Windows Hello on Windows PCs). This approach lets users sign transactions natively without needing an external security key.

**Recover access and secure accounts with cloud-synced passkey**

Cloud-synced passkey helps users recover access if they lose a device.

## Limitations of passkey

**Passkey functionality varies by authenticator**

Some security keys do not support biometric authentication, requiring users to enter a PIN instead. Also, because WebAuthn does not provide access to private keys, users must store their passkey securely or enable cloud synchronization for recovery.

**Cloud synchronization introduces potential risks**

Cloud-synced passkey improves accessibility but also create risks if a cloud provider is compromised or if a user loses access to their cloud account. Users who prefer full self-custody can rely on hardware-based passkey that does not use cloud synchronization.

**Passkey cannot be exported**

Users cannot transfer a passkey between different authenticators. For example, a passkey created on a security key cannot move to another device unless it syncs through a cloud provider. To avoid losing access, users should set up authentication on multiple devices.
