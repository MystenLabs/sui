Long-term access to historical on-chain data is essential for developers, although full nodes enforce limited retention for scalability and performance. The Archival Store and Service provide a scalable, consistent foundation for accessing historical data on Sui beyond what full nodes or indexer databases typically retain. This infrastructure serves as the historical backbone for GraphQL RPC, gRPC-based apps, and data platforms, providing efficient point lookups for old transactions, checkpoints, and object states, even after full nodes have pruned them.

## When to use

Both developers and RPC and data providers benefit from using the Archival Store and Service, though their goals and usage patterns differ.

### Developers

Use the Archival Store and Service to:

- Access historical data for rendering UI features like transaction history, object lineage, and previous app states.
- Rely on hosted archival services for long-term data to avoid infrastructure overhead.
- Implement fallback mechanisms in apps that query archival data if full nodes or indexer databases return insufficient retention.

### RPC and data providers

Use the Archival Store and Service to:

- Operate a differentiated infrastructure service by offering historical data access to developers.
- Extend the retention horizon of GraphQL or gRPC-based APIs through the Archival Service.
- Maintain operational independence by running your own Archival Store and Service (using Bigtable or a custom backend).

## How the Archival Store and Service fits into the application stack

- **Archival Store:** A long-term storage system (such as [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable)) that holds checkpoint-indexed Sui data.
- **Archival Service:** A [gRPC API (LedgerService)](/concepts/data-access/grpc) layer that exposes access to this store, enabling point lookups of historical data.

You can query the archival store through the gRPC-based Archival Service for missing data when using a full node and power GraphQL RPC queries that span unretained data. You can host the service yourself, use a provider, or rely on the public-good version (with rate limits).
