The [GraphQL RPC Service](/concepts/data-access/graphql-rpc.mdx) is a performant GraphQL RPC layer that reads data from the General-purpose Indexer's Postgres-compatible database, [Archival Store and Service](#archival-store-and-service), and a full node. GraphQL RPC is an alternative to the gRPC API. 

The GraphQL RPC Service is a lightweight server component that allows you to combine data from multiple tables in the Postgres-compatible database using GraphQL's expressive querying system, which is appealing to frontend developers.

The General-purpose Indexer includes a performant and scalable implementation of the [custom indexing framework](/guides/developer/accessing-data/custom-indexing-framework.mdx). The underlying framework uses the remote checkpoint store and full node RPCs to ingest data.

The General-purpose Indexer is declarative in the sense that you can seamlessly configure it to load different kinds of Sui network data into Postgres relational tables in parallel. This improves the performance of data ingestion into the Postgres-compatible database. In addition, you can configure pruning for different tables in the Postgres-compatible database, allowing you to tune it for the desired combination of performance and cost characteristics.

:::info

GraphQL RPC Server and General-purpose Indexer are in beta, which is a near-stable release that is subject to change based on user feedback. You can use them for testing and production readiness in non-production environments.

:::

## When to use

Use GraphQL RPC with the General-purpose Indexer as a flexible and ergonomic data API to build rich dashboards, explorers, and data-driven apps. The API is powered by an indexer created using the custom indexing framework.

## How GraphQL RPC and General-purpose Indexer fit into the application stack

If you are using the **deprecated** JSON-RPC in your application, you can migrate to GraphQL RPC by either self-operating the combined stack of General-purpose Indexer, Postgres-compatible database, and GraphQL RPC server, or by utilizing it as a service from an RPC provider or indexer operator.

## High-level release timeline

The target times indicated are tentative and subject to updates based on project progress and your feedback.

| Tentative time | Milestone | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| :heavy_check_mark: September 2025 | Beta release of GraphQL RPC Server and General-purpose Indexer. | You can start validating the setup of General-purpose Indexer, along with testing the GraphQL RPC Server to access the indexed Sui data. You can also start migrating your application in the non-production environments, and share feedback on the improvements you want to see. |
| :heavy_check_mark: September-October 2025 | Deprecation of JSON-RPC. | **JSON-RPC is deprecated at this point and migration notice period starts.** |
| December-January 2025 | GA release of GraphQL RPC Server and General-purpose Indexer. | Begin migration and cutover of your application in the production environment. |
| April 2026 | End of migration timeline. | **JSON-RPC is fully deactivated at this point.** This timeline assumes about 7 months of migration notice period. |
