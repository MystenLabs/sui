Building a custom indexer on Sui lets you take full control of data ingestion, storage, and processing. You can choose from multiple [checkpoint data sources](#checkpoint-data-sources) such as remote store, local files, or direct RPC API access, depending on whether you're indexing Mainnet data, testing against known checkpoints, or working on a local network.

For storage, you can either use the built-in `IndexerCluster` with PostgreSQL or implement your own [`Store` and `Connection` traits](#byos) to integrate a different database or storage backend. After connected, you can wire up a manual indexer, add your custom pipelines, and handle watermark coordination to keep data in sync.

Finally, you need to [deserialize Move events](#deserialize) from raw BCS bytes into Rust structs, using `bcs` and `serde`, so that your pipelines can work with strongly-typed data. This gives you a reproducible, end-to-end setup that you can tune for performance, reliability, and custom analytics.

## Checkpoint data sources {#checkpoint-data-sources}

The `sui-indexer-alt-framework` supports multiple data sources for accessing Sui blockchain data.You configure these sources through command-line arguments. They fall into two categories: **push-based** and **polling-based**.

### Push-based data sources

Push-based sources deliver real-time checkpoint data as it becomes available, offering lower latency than polling.

#### Recommended: gRPC streaming

gRPC streaming delivers real-time checkpoint data pushed from full nodes for the latest checkpoints. Because it only streams latest data, you must configure a polling-based fallback source (remote store, local path, or full node RPC) to retrieve historical checkpoints and ensure reliability:

```sh
$ cargo run -- --remote-store-url https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io --streaming-url https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
```

**Endpoint format:** `https://fullnode.NETWORK.sui.io:443` where `NETWORK` is one of the available networks:

- `testnet`
- `devnet`
- `mainnet`

**When to use gRPC streaming:**

- Production indexers that require minimal latency
- Real-time data processing pipelines
- Applications that need immediate checkpoint updates

:::info

- Always configure a polling-based fallback source (like `--remote-store-url`) to ensure reliability and access to historical data.
- The streaming connection automatically falls back to the polling source when streaming is unavailable or when historical checkpoints are needed.

:::

### Polling-based data sources

Polling-based sources periodically check for new checkpoints using the polling mechanism provided by the [indexing framework](/guides/developer/accessing-data/custom-indexing-framework.mdx).

#### Remote store

The most direct stream source is a subscription to a remote checkpoint store. Sui provides the following endpoints:

- **Testnet**: `https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io`
- **Mainnet**: `https://checkpoints.mainnet.sui.io`

```sh
$ cargo run -- --remote-store-url https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io
```

#### Local path

Local checkpoint files are useful for development and testing scenarios:

```sh
$ cargo run -- --local-ingestion-path /path/to/checkpoints
```

**Common use cases:**

- Unit and integration testing with known checkpoint data
- Development workflows with reproducible datasets

#### Full node RPC

Full node RPC queries use gRPC:

```sh
$ cargo run -- --rpc-api-url https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
```

**Endpoint format:** `https://fullnode.NETWORK.sui.io:443` where `NETWORK` is one of the available networks:

- `testnet`
- `devnet`
- `mainnet`

**When to use RPC API:**

- Networks without official remote store (devnet, localnet, custom networks)
- Development against local Sui networks
