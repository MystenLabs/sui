## Representing in-game objects on chain

What makes a game a Web3 game is that some of the objects within the game reside on a blockchain. Whether it's in-game currency, battle passes, skins, or any number of other objects, knowing how to create and integrate these items is the first step in building the desired user experience on Sui.

### In-game currencies

In-game currencies allow users to purchase game features like items, upgrades, and premium content. Before Web3, these currencies remained only in the game and their values were set by the game developers. 

Using Sui, players can now have true ownership of their in-game currency. The currency exists as a token on the Sui blockchain, where players can conceivably buy, sell, or swap that currency for anything else that also lives on chain. If you create an ecosystem of games, players can purchase currency in one of your games but spend it in another one that also uses that same currency. The possibilities are vast, but you must first learn how to create the currency. The following topics can get you started.

- [Coin Standard](../standards/coin.mdx)
- [In-Game Currency](../guides/developer/coin/in-game-token.mdx)

### Tokens

Similar to in-game currencies, tokens provide a level of engagement and control integrated into the game experience that isn't possible without Web3. For example, you can create tokens associated with your game that reward loyalty amongst your user base. You can also produce regulated tokens that allow the bearer of a specific capability to control the addresses that have access to the token, facilitating gated access to special events, leagues, or other game features. The following topics provide more insight into tokens on Sui.

- [Regulated Coin and Deny List](../guides/developer/coin/regulated.mdx)
- [Loyalty Tokens](../guides/developer/coin/loyalty.mdx)
- [Closed-Loop Token](../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx)

### Game features

NFTs are able to represent many traditional game features. For example, in-game objects, battle passes, rewards, skins, game cards or keys, and loot boxes are just a few of the features that you can create using NFTs on Sui. The following topics and sections provide more details.

- [Create a Non-Fungible Token](../guides/developer/nft.mdx)
- [Sui Object Display](../standards/display.mdx)
- [Display implementation](#display-implementation) 
- [Soulbound assets](#soulbound-assets)
- [Game economies](#game-economies)

### Display implementation {#display-implementation}

### Dynamic assets {#dynamic-assets}

On Sui, everything is an object and all objects are NFTs. For the purpose of the gaming discussion, you can also think of these NFTs as game assets. 

You can view an object on Sui as a key-value pair data structure. In Move, the smart contract language of Sui, objects are defined as a `struct`. As an example, consider the game board of a tic-tac-toe game: 

{@inject: examples/tic-tac-toe/move/sources/owned.move#struct=Game noComments}

The first key-value pair for any object is `id: address`, which is a unique value of type `UID`. Every object has a different address, which is why every object is an NFT because this mandatory key-value pair sets each object apart and makes it unique.

#### Creating assets

Smart contracts contain the functions that create objects. Using the previous example, the function (`new`) that creates the object represented (a digital tic-tac-toe gameboard) provides the values for each attribute. The Sui framework creates the UID that uniquely identifies this particular game.

{@inject: examples/tic-tac-toe/move/sources/owned.move#fun=new noComments}

This is an on-chain action, or transaction. In this case, the transaction is a request to the chain to create an object. You provide the necessary data to the function and pay the gas fee for the computation effort of the network validators. The result is the creation of a new NFT that exists on the Sui blockchain at the address (`id`).

#### Updating assets

On Sui, you can update an NFT asset using a separate transaction, provided the smart contract that defines the NFT allows it. Similar to creation, you provide data to the relevant update function and pay the gas fee, and the smart contract updates the object at the correct address with the new information. 

Using the tic-tac-toe example, you might instruct the smart contract to update the gameboard object to place an `x` on an available square. Because the computation effort required for most updates is less than the effort to create the original object, the resulting gas fees are typically less, as well.

#### Composing assets

On Sui, you can include one object inside of another (dynamic fields). For example, an object named `Parent` might contain objects of type `Child`. The smart contract can provide the necessary functions to add and remove the child objects from their parents. 

{@inject: examples/move/dynamic_fields/sources/example.move#struct=Parent,Child}

The function to add child objects to a parent might resemble the following. In this case, `ofield` is an alias for the `sui::dynamic_object_field` package.

{@inject: examples/move/dynamic_fields/sources/example.move#fun=add_child}

You can apply dynamic fields to many use cases. An object named `TicketBooth`, for example, could contain objects of type `ConcertTicket`. An object of type `Car` might have a field named `is_functioning` that is `false` until all necessary objects (`Engine`, `Tires`, `Body`, `Wheel`) are present, at which point it can automatically update its `is_functioning` field to `true`.

Composability is a really important feature of Sui. While it provides many options when developing an idea on Sui, it also allows building on top of existing projects, using third-party assets in your project. This can range from “*Only users who own a particular NFT are eligible for a discount*” to full collaboration between two distinct projects and everything in between on the smart contract level.

#### Transfer to object

Sui enables more use cases with the transfer to object feature, which allows an owned object to be sent to another object (shared or owned). In this case, the sent object appears as owned by the parent object. In the above examples, the objects are wrapped inside other objects and this can be seen in the parent object's metadata when inspecting the parent object.

When an object is sent to another object, the metadata of the parent object remain the same, but its `id` has a new object. This feature can enable use cases such as on-chain wallets where a `Wallet` object is used to deposit other objects. Combining this with transfer to object can lead to complex and exciting use cases.

#### Deleting assets

On Sui, you can delete an object if the smart contract allows the operation. If the correct smart contract function is present, then you can delete the object in a single transaction. This results in a gas-fee rebate, which happens whenever bytes are freed on chain. The transaction's gas payer receives a rebate to account for the future storage of the object no longer being necessary but having already been paid for. See the [Storage fund](./tokenomics#storage-fund) section in Tokenomics to learn more about rebates. 

### Soulbound assets {#soulbound-assets}

A soulbound asset is an NFT that belongs to an address and cannot be transferred or deleted. 

On Sui, assets are usually freely transferable between addresses, but this is undesirable behavior in some cases.

Assets such as game season passes, loyalty accrual assets, avatars, identification assets for a product, and assets that grant certain privileges at the smart contract level are well-suited to be bound to an address without the option of transfer or deletion.

On Sui, it is straightforward to implement such an asset, and the infrastructure guarantees that the desired behavior always holds.

You define an NFT asset as soulbound at the contract level. After designated as soulbound, it cannot be converted to a normal transferable asset. Changing it would require creating a new asset with the same name and a migration strategy, such as deleting the soulbound asset and creating a normal one to take its place.

Soulbound assets are created by omitting the `store` ability. Without this ability, you cannot store soulbound assets inside other objects. Keep this behavior in mind when deciding the asset type. This means that Soulbound assets are not fully composable; they can store other assets but cannot be stored inside other assets.

The same pattern can be used to implement NFT assets that are transferable/burnable only under certain circumstances. You can define these circumstances at the smart contract level by making the asset soulbound and defining custom transfer and burn functions.

## Game economies

On Sui, owned objects are either freely transferable or non-transferable. To ensure royalties, Sui provides a standard called Kiosk. See [Sui Kiosk](../) for an in-depth look at the Kiosk standard.

### Kiosk

A kiosk is a shared object that restricts access to a single address or user. 

The kiosk "owner" (although a shared object has no owner from the perspective of Sui, the smart contract ensures that only one address is permitted to access it) is allowed to:

- Place Assets from their address inside the Kiosk.
- Take Assets from the Kiosk back to their address.
- Lock Assets from their address or already placed inside the Kiosk, making the “take” operation impossible.
- Destroy a Kiosk that has no Assets inside.
- List an Asset for sale with a price denoted in SUI.
- List an Asset for sale only to a specific address, with the price denoted in SUI.

Any other address is allowed to:

- Buy an item that has undergone the “list” operation.
- Buy an item meant for a specific address if the asset was “listed” in such a way.

The adoption of Kiosks implies that marketplaces become aggregators of “listed” items inside different Kiosks.

An Asset that has undergone the “lock” operation cannot undergo the “take” operation anymore; it can only undergo the “list” operation.

### Transfer Policy

The “buy” operation requires the use of another Object called Transfer Policy. This is usually a Shared Object and contains Rules that govern the “buy” operation, the most common Rule being “Royalties.”

A “buy” operation cannot be completed for an Asset without a defined Transfer Policy.

An empty Transfer Policy, one that does not have Rules, means that the Asset is freely tradable. Since Kiosk only allows the “list” and “buy” pair of operations, a transfer is possible by setting the price to 0 SUI.

Rules can be anything programmable with Move. To use marketplaces, an Asset creator should use Rules defined in https://github.com/MystenLabs/apps/tree/main/kiosk/sources/rules

Common Rules include:

- **Royalty Rule:** A percentage of the price that goes to the Asset creator (practically it goes inside the Transfer Policy and the creator may transfer it at any point in time).
- **Floor Price Rule:** A minimum price that an Asset may be “listed” for.
- **Lock Rule:** Enforce the Asset to be locked inside a Kiosk after a “buy” operation.

The combination of the Lock Rule and the Royalty Rule enforces royalties to be paid to the creator. The Lock Rule ensures an Asset cannot be “taken” out of a Kiosk (to be freely traded), while the Royalty Rule ensures that any Asset traded through Kiosk will have royalties deducted from the transaction.

Adding the Lock Rule is recommended when royalties are a strict requirement. As long as marketplaces support only Kiosk on Sui, even without the Lock Rule, users may not have other options. It is safe to assume that peer-to-peer trading is unsafe, and most, if not all, users will avoid it since there is no way to ensure the transaction will take place smoothly. In peer-to-peer transactions, someone has to initiate either the Asset transfer or the payment transfer, and there are no guarantees that the follow-up will take place.

The most important thing is during the initial airdrop or minting of the asset to ensure the Asset is put inside a Kiosk and not sent to an address directly.

## ShadowQuest integration on Sui

ShadowQuest is a multiplayer game that combines fantasy with RPG battle mechanics. To enhance the gaming experience with Web3 technologies, ShadowQuest is integrating with Sui offering seamless blockchain interactions to players without compromising the overall gaming experience.

### Seamless player onboarding and wallet integration
    
ShadowQuest wants to onboard players without adding complexity, especially those unfamiliar with Web3. By using [zkLogin](../../concepts/cryptography/zklogin.mdx), users can sign in using social platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitch, and Apple. This automatically creates a Sui wallet linked to their ShadowQuest account, making blockchain interactions seamless.
    
### Simplified transaction handling 
    
Players in ShadowQuest earn or use in-game assets such as NFTs or $SHADOW tokens. To attract users unfamiliar with Web3, ShadowQuest manages game transactions to avoid Web3 friction, like wallets popping up for signing transactions. By sponsoring user transactions, the friction is minimized because ShadowQuest users do not directly pay for transaction costs and gas fees.
    
    **Enoki** transactions can be signed without requiring confirmation from the user to approve the transaction.
    
    **Enoki Gas Pool** is used to sponsor transactions, covering gas fees for players. This ensures all in-game transactions are seamless and cost-free for players, providing a better user experience.
    
3. **NFT Marketplace and Royalty Enforcement**
    
    **Use Case**: ShadowQuest allows players to buy, sell, or trade in-game items, such as weapons, armor, and cosmetics. The items should respect royalties to ensure that creators benefit from each txn.
    
    **Sui Feature**: **Kiosk** provides a decentralized marketplace solution, ensuring royalties are enforced on all NFT trades. This helps both the game developers and creators maintain control over secondary sales, ensuring revenue generation throughout the asset's lifecycle.
    
4. **NFT Usage for Game Access**
    
    **Use Case**: ShadowQuest uses NFTs as entry tickets for different game modes and events. Players can acquire or earn various Runes, which grant access to specific game challenges or seasonal competitions. These NFTs cannot be traded or transfered to their players
    
    **Sui Feature**: **Soulbound NFTs** represent different Runes that are either earned through gameplay or purchased. These NFTs grant exclusive access to matches and seasonal challenges but cannot be traded once bound to a player.

## ArcaneBattles Integration on Sui

**Use Case:** Leveraging blockchain to enhance a digital card game experience

ArcaneBattles is a strategic, multiplayer card game inspired by classics like Hearthstone. Players collect, trade, and battle with a variety of magical cards representing spells, creatures, and heroes. By integrating with the Sui blockchain, ArcaneBattles aims to enrich the gameplay experience through decentralized features that promote true ownership, fairness, and a dynamic in-game economy.

### Use Cases

### Dynamic In-Game Economy with Dualtwo Closed Loop Tokens

**Use Case:** Implement two stable in-game currencies to facilitate various transactions, enhancing player engagement and economic depth.

- **Sui Feature Used:** **Closed Loop Token (CLT)**
    
    ArcaneBattles utilizes two Closed Loop Tokens within its ecosystem:
    
    1. **Arcane Gems:** The primary in-game currency used to purchase card packs and enter tournaments. Players earn Arcane Gems through gameplay achievements, daily quests, and participating in events. This token ensures that all players have access to essential game features without exposure to external market volatility.
    2. **Mystic Dust:** A secondary token obtained by discarding unwanted cards. Mystic Dust is used to craft new cards and upgrade existing ones to "gold" versions, which have enhanced visuals and possibly minor gameplay benefits. This mirrors the crafting system in games like Hearthstone, allowing players to strategically manage their collections and customize their decks.
    
    The dual-token system adds depth to the in-game economy, encouraging players to engage in various activities and make strategic decisions about resource allocation.
    

### **True Ownership and NFT Card Rental**

**Use Case:** Allow players to own their cards as NFTs and provide a rental marketplace for rare or powerful cards.

- **Sui Feature Used:** **NFT Rental**
    
    Each card in ArcaneBattles is represented as an NFT on the Sui blockchain, granting players true ownership of their digital assets. The NFT Rental feature allows players to rent out their rare or high-level cards to others for a fee. This creates a community-driven economy where new or casual players can access powerful cards temporarily, while owners earn passive income from their collections.
    

### **Fair and Unpredictable Gameplay**

**Use Case:** Ensure randomness in card draws and in-game events to prevent manipulation and enhance fairness.

- **Sui Feature Used:** **On-Chain Randomness**
    
    By leveraging Sui's On-Chain Randomness, ArcaneBattles introduces unpredictable elements such as random card draws, critical hit chances, and random effects from certain cards. This randomness is verifiable and secure, preventing manipulation by any party and maintaining fairness across all gameplay aspects.
    

### **Enhanced Card Visualization and Dynamic Wear Mechanism**

**Use Case:** Provide rich, dynamic displays of card information and introduce a wear-and-tear mechanic to simulate card degradation over time.

- **Sui Feature Used:** **Display Standard**
    
    ArcaneBattles uses Sui's Display Standard to offer detailed metadata for each card NFT, including stats, abilities, and artwork. Beyond static information, the game introduces a dynamic display mechanism where cards visually show signs of wear as they are used in battles. Over time, frequently used cards may appear scratched, faded, or have other visual cues indicating wear. After extensive use, cards have a chance to be destroyed entirely.
    
    This wear-and-tear mechanic simulates the experience of physical card games, where rare cards are often kept in pristine condition and used sparingly. It encourages players to strategically decide when to use their valuable cards and adds a layer of depth to the game's economy and strategy.
    
    Players can mitigate or repair wear on their cards by using **Mystic Dust** to restore them or upgrade them to gold versions, which are more durable and feature enhanced visuals. This system adds a strategic resource management element, as players must balance the benefits of using powerful cards against the potential cost of their degradation.

### **Sui Features Explained**

- **Closed Loop Token (CLT):** Introduces game-specific currencies (**Arcane Gems** and **Mystic Dust**) that operate within the ArcaneBattles ecosystem. CLTs are not traded on external exchanges, helping maintain economic balance and shielding the in-game economy from external market fluctuations.
- **NFT Rental:** Enables ownership and temporary transfer of NFTs, allowing card owners to rent out their assets securely through smart contracts. This promotes accessibility and creates a new revenue stream within the player community.
- **On-Chain Randomness:** Provides a secure and unbiased source of randomness for in-game events, ensuring fair gameplay mechanics that cannot be tampered with by any party.
- **Display Standard:** Ensures that NFTs have standardized metadata and visual representations across different platforms. The dynamic display mechanism allows for visual changes to NFTs over time, such as wear and degradation, enhancing the user experience by reflecting the card's usage history.

By integrating these Sui blockchain features, ArcaneBattles not only enhances the gaming experience but also pioneers the next generation of digital card games. The dual-token economy adds complexity and depth to in-game transactions, encouraging strategic decision-making. The wear-and-tear mechanic introduces a novel layer of strategy and realism, as players must consider the longevity of their cards. Together, these features create a rich, engaging, and immersive experience that leverages the full potential of blockchain technology within a gaming context.
