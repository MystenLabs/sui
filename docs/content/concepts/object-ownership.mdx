Every object has an owner field that dictates how you can use it in transactions. Objects can have the following types of ownership:


<Cards>
<Card title="Address-Owned" href="/concepts/object-ownership/address-owned">
An address-owned object is owned by a specific 32-byte address that is either an account address (derived from a particular signature scheme) or an object ID. An address-owned object is accessible only to its owner and no others. 
</Card>
<Card title="Immutable" href="/concepts/object-ownership/immutable">
An immutable object is an object that can't be mutated, transferred, or deleted. Immutable objects have no owner, so anyone can use them.
</Card>
<Card title="Party" href="/concepts/object-ownership/party">
A party object is an object that is transferred using the `0x2::transfer::party_transfer` or `0x2::transfer::public_party_transfer` function and is accessible by the `Party` to which it is transferred. Party objects can be singly owned, but unlike address-owned objects, they are versioned by consensus.
</Card>
<Card title="Shared" href="/concepts/object-ownership/shared">
A shared object is an object that is shared using the `0x2::transfer::share_object` function and is accessible to everyone. Unlike owned objects, anyone can access shared ones on the network.
</Card>
<Card title="Wrapped" href="/concepts/object-ownership/wrapped">
In Move, you can organize data structures by putting a field of `struct` type in another.
