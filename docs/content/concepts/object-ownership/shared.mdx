A shared object is an object that is shared using the `sui::transfer::share_object` function and is accessible to everyone. Unlike owned objects, anyone can access shared ones on the network. Extended functionality and accessibility of this kind of objects requires additional effort by securing access, if needed.

Shared objects require the `key` ability.

## Example

The following example creates a shop to sell digital donuts. Everyone needs access to the shop to purchase donuts from it, so the example creates the shop as a shared object using `sui::transfer::share_object`.

```move
module examples::donuts;

use sui::sui::SUI;
use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};
use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};

/// For when Coin balance is too low.
const ENotEnough: u64 = 0;

/// Capability that grants an owner the right to collect profits.
public struct ShopOwnerCap has key { id: UID }

/// A purchasable Donut. For simplicity's sake we ignore implementation.
public struct Donut has key { id: UID }

/// A shared object. `key` ability is required.
public struct DonutShop has key {
    id: UID,
    price: u64,
    balance: Balance<SUI>
}

/// Init function is often ideal place for initializing
/// a shared object as it is called only once.
fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    transfer::transfer(ShopOwnerCap {
        id: object::new(ctx)
    }, ctx.sender());

    // Share the object to make it accessible to everyone!
    transfer::share_object(DonutShop {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        price: 1000,
        balance: balance::zero()
    })
}

/// Entry function available to everyone who owns a Coin.
public fun buy_donut(
    shop: &mut DonutShop, payment: &mut Coin<SUI>, ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    assert!(coin::value(payment) >= shop.price, ENotEnough);

    // Take amount = `shop.price` from Coin<SUI>
    let paid = payment.balance_mut.split(shop.price);

    // Put the coin to the Shop's balance
    shop.balance.join(paid);

    transfer::transfer(Donut {
        id: object::new(ctx)
    }, ctx.sender())
}

/// Consume donut and get nothing...
public fun eat_donut(d: Donut) {
    let Donut { id } = d;
    id.delete();
}

/// Take coin from `DonutShop` and transfer it to tx sender.
/// Requires authorization with `ShopOwnerCap`.
public fun collect_profits(
    _: &ShopOwnerCap, shop: &mut DonutShop, ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let amount = shop.balance.value();
    let profits = shop.balance.split(amount).into_coin(ctx);

    transfer::public_transfer(profits, ctx.sender())
}
```
