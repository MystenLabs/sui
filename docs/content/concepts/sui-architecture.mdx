title: Sui Architecture
---

Sui shares some similarities with other blockchains but is unique in many ways. Use the topics in this section to understand the features that define the Sui network.

## Understand Sui Security

Learn about the mechanisms available to secure on-chain assets, and the assurances Sui provides regarding asset security. Understand Sui Security explores the overall Sui security architecture to ensure the asset types you design leverage Sui to provide a secure experience for asset holders.

Go to [Understand Sui Security](./sui-architecture/sui-security.mdx).

## Life of a Transaction

Life of a Transaction details the transitions that all transactions on Sui go through from creation to finality. This topic also explores some features of the blockchain (like epochs and checkpoints) that play a role in the life of a transaction.

Go to [Life of a Transaction](./sui-architecture/transaction-lifecycle.mdx).

## Consensus

Every transaction on Sui is sequenced by consensus, where validators agree to the same order of execution of the transactions, even if a minority of them are down or are malicious actors that want to harm the network and users.
Sui currently uses Narwhal and Bullshark for consensus, but will transition to [Mysticeti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821) soon.

Go to [Consensus](./sui-architecture/consensus.mdx).

## Sui Indexer

Running a Sui indexer offloads data processing from your Full node and stores it in a relational database. This topic explores some of the benefits running an indexer has and points to instruction on how to run your own. 

Go to [Sui Indexer](./sui-architecture/indexer-functions.mdx).

## Protocol Upgrades

The Sui protocol, framework, and execution engine are frequently extended to include new functionality and bug fixes. This functionality is added in the form of new code which is released to validator operators as part of our regular software releases. The Sui protocol, however, requires that all Sui validators agree about the results of executing each transaction.
