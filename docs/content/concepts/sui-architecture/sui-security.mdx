title: Understand Sui Security
description: Sui provides strong security guarantees to asset owners. Assets on Sui can be used only by their owners according to the logic defined in auditable smart contracts. The network remains available and correct even if some validators fail or act maliciously (fault tolerance).

This page provides an overview of the security guarantees Sui provides.  

Sui asset owners and smart contract designers can learn about the mechanisms available to secure assets, and the assurances Sui provides. Smart contract designers can also understand the security architecture to ensure the asset types they design provide strong protections to asset holders.  

## Security features {#security-features}

Sui provides strong security guarantees to asset owners:  

- Only the owner of an asset can authorize a transaction that operates on it. Authorization uses a private signature key known only to the asset owner.  
- Everyone can operate on shared or immutable assets, but smart contracts can implement additional access controls.  
- Transactions operate on assets according to predefined rules set by the smart contract that defines the asset type. These rules are written in Move.  
- Once a transaction is finalized, its effects—such as changes to existing assets or creation of new assets—are persisted and available for further processing.  
- Sui operates through a protocol between independent validators, and preserves security properties even if some validators act incorrectly.  
- All operations on Sui can be audited. This transparency ensures correctness, though users may wish to use multiple addresses to protect privacy.  
- Validators are chosen periodically when users lock and delegate SUI tokens to them.  

## Security architecture {#security-architecture}

Validators operate the network by processing transactions and running the Sui protocol, which ensures agreement on valid transactions.  

Sui’s consensus protocols tolerate some validators behaving incorrectly. Each validator has voting power based on delegated stake. Sui maintains all security properties if more than two-thirds of the stake is assigned to honest validators. Some auditing properties remain intact even if more validators are faulty.  

### Addresses and ownership {#addresses-and-ownership}

A Sui transaction is valid only if the owner of all affected assets signs it with their private key. The private key remains secret and is never shared, making it infeasible for another party to operate on an owned asset undetected—even if validators misbehave.  

A private key corresponds to a public address that can receive assets or enforce access control through smart contracts. Users may have multiple addresses for convenience or privacy. Addresses do not need pre-registration. Sending an asset to an address automatically creates it, but users must carefully verify recipient addresses to avoid irrevocable loss.  

### Smart contracts define asset types {#smart-contracts}

All assets have a type defined in a smart contract. Sui provides system contracts, such as those managing the SUI token, but anyone can write and publish custom contracts. Transactions can call only the operations defined in the contract that created the asset type.  

Users should operate with contracts they trust and that have been audited. Sui smart contracts are immutable, enabling audits and preventing tampering.  

The Move language is designed for auditability and verification. Shared assets allow multiple users to interact safely according to rules defined in the contract. A contract can restrict how and by whom shared assets are used.  

### Transaction finality {#transaction-finality}

To finalize a transaction, validators must certify it and submit its certificate across the network. Even if some validators misbehave, correct validators finalize the transaction through Byzantine fault tolerant protocols. These ensure:  

- **Safety:** Faulty validators cannot convince honest clients of an incorrect state.  
- **Liveness:** Faulty validators cannot prevent transaction processing.  

Every transaction must include a gas object to cover execution costs. A transaction may succeed or abort. Aborts can happen due to smart contract conditions or insufficient gas. In either case, gas is charged to prevent denial-of-service attacks.  

Users can submit transactions directly or use third-party services. These services do not require access to private keys and cannot forge transactions. They can confirm finality using validator signatures. Once finalized, users can trust that changes persist in Sui state.  

### Auditing and privacy {#auditing-and-privacy}

Validators let users read all stored assets and view the full transaction history. They also provide cryptographic evidence of the chain of transactions that led to an asset’s state. Clients can validate this evidence to ensure correctness.  

Because all transactions are public, privacy-conscious users may use multiple addresses or custodial/non-custodial services. Smart contracts can also add cryptographic privacy protections.  

### Censorship resistance and openness {#censorship-resistance-openness}

Sui uses delegated proof of stake to determine validators each epoch. Users lock and delegate SUI tokens to choose the validator set. Anyone with sufficient stake can operate a validator.  

Validators earn rewards from gas fees and distribute rewards to their delegators. Validators with poor reliability, and their delegators, may earn lower rewards. However, stake cannot be confiscated by malicious validators or anyone else.  

This mechanism ensures validator accountability. Validators can be rotated out if they attempt censorship or behave unreliably. Through validator choice, users influence the evolution of the Sui network.
