description: Historical data and storage pricing provide insights into the cost of operations on the Sui network.
---

The cost of operating on any blockchain has two main components: **compute**, the power required to process logic, and **storage**, the digital space needed to store data and results.

Compute is relatively fixed on Sui, with hundreds of validators running 24-core, 128GB RAM machines.

Because Sui achieves high throughput compared to other blockchains, storage costs can vary significantly.

The following table summarizes the main storage components:

| Storage category    | Storage type         | Usage description                                                                                                                                                            | Mainnet storage needs (as of May 2024) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Validators          | RocksDB, SSD storage | Validators store the latest consensus data on high-performance NVMe disks.                                                                                                   | ~200GB                                 |
| Pruning full nodes  | RocksDB, SSD storage | Pruning full nodes maintain unpruned RocksDB indexes for efficient querying.                                                                                                 | ~1.6TB                                 |
| Unpruned full nodes | RocksDB, SSD storage | Unpruned full nodes retain full object and transaction history for complete archival.                                                                                        | ~4.9TB                                 |
| Full node snapshots | Cloud storage        | Snapshots of full node data are stored in cloud storage for validator or full node backup and recovery.                                                                      | ~1.6TB                                 |
| State-sync archival | Cloud storage        | State-sync archival stores blockchain state data in cloud storage to support syncing of historical objects that might have been pruned.                                        | ~1.3TB                                 |

## Validators

Validators should enable pruning to limit database growth. Transaction-per-second (TPS) rates affect growth, but storing full transaction and object history is the main factor. Transaction type also influences data growth.

The image above shows Mainnet growth in 2024:

- Over a 90-day period with ~18 TPS, disk usage increased from 203GB to 215GB (~130MB per day).
- Over a two-week period with ~183 TPS, disk usage grew from 215GB to 271GB (~4GB per day).

These results show storage growth increases relative to TPS rates.

## Pruning full nodes

Pruning full nodes are similar in disk usage to validators because pruning settings are the same. There are two exceptions:

- Full nodes keep a `consensus_db`, which accounts for about half of validator disk usage.
- If the node serves RPC queries, the `indexes/` directory in Mainnet consumes significant space. Currently, `indexes/` is 1.5TB and grows with TPS.

The total disk usage of a pruned full node with indexes is ~1.6TB. With indexing disabled, usage is ~100GB.

## Unpruned full nodes

Unpruned full nodes are uncommon and apply to a few use cases:

1. You need the entire chain state on one machine.
2. You want to enable state-sync without using a cloud archival fallback. Using an unpruned node as a peer avoids configuring an archival bucket.

Growth examples:

- Over a 90-day period with ~18 TPS, usage increased from 3.4TB to 4.34TB (~10GB per day).
- Over a two-week period with ~183 TPS, usage grew from 4.34TB to 4.92TB (~40GB per day).

## Full node snapshots

There are two types of [snapshots](/guides/operator/snapshots.mdx):

- **Database snapshots:** Equal in size to the database of the full node that produced them (1:1 copy).
- **Formal snapshots:** Lightweight, ~30GB for recent Mainnet epochs (as of May 2024).

## State-sync archival

State-sync archival stores blockchain state data in a cloud storage bucket written by a full node or ingestion daemon.

Growth examples:

- Over a 90-day period, usage increased from 867GB to 1.18TB (~3GB per day).
- Over a two-week period, usage grew from 1.18TB to 1.32TB (~10GB per day).
