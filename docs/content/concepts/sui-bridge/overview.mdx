title: Sui Bridge Overview
draft: true
---

Sui Bridge is the native bridge for Sui Network. Unlike third-party solutions, a native bridge is typically built into the core architecture of a blockchain, ensuring optimal integration and operation. It allows users to move digital assets from one chain to another, preserving security and maintaining interoperability between diverse ecosystems. Sui Bridge is a cutting-edge native bridge on Sui, designed to enhance interoperability between Sui and Ethereum. It enables users to securely and efficiently transfer native and wrapped ETH to and from Sui. The bridge leverages the unique capabilities of the Sui network to offer fast transaction speeds, lower transaction costs, and a decentralized architecture.

Users bridge tokens in the officail website: https://bridge.sui.io/.

## Operation and Governance
Sui Bridge is operated and governed by Sui network validators. Sui Bridge is secured and governed by the same set of validators that secure the Sui network. Bridge transfers and other actions require validator signatures with a minimal threshold of voting power.

Similar to the Sui network, all governance related to the Sui Bridge is done via validator voting.

## Supported Chains and Tokens
As of writing, Sui Bridge supports token bridging between Sui and Ethereum Mainnet with the following supported assets:
* Ethereum (ETH)
  * The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, widely used for transactions and smart contract interactions.
* Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)
  * The wrapped version of native Ethereum.
These assets can be transferred both to and from the Sui network, utilizing the bridgeâ€™s capabilities to provide fast, secure, and efficient cross-chain transactions.
