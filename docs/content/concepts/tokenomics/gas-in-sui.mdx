title: Gas in Sui
description: To perform a transaction on Sui, an account on the network must pay for computation and storage. Learn how gas fees, units, rebates, and budgets work on the Sui network.
---

Every transaction on the Sui network incurs gas fees to cover:

- Computation: The work required to execute the transaction.
- Storage: The long-term cost of storing any objects created or modified.

The following formula defines the cost of network transactions:

total_gas_fees = computation_units * reference_gas_price + storage_units * storage_price

Gas fees are reduced if the transaction deletes stored data. In that case, users receive a rebate:

net_gas_fees = computation_gas_fee + storage_gas_fee - storage_rebate

Gas Prices {#gas-prices}
Reference gas price: Converts compute time into SUI units. It’s updated each epoch.

Storage price: Converts on-chain data storage into SUI. It changes infrequently.

These prices are set by validators and apply across the network.

Gas Units {#gas-units}
Sui uses two unit types:

Computation units

Storage units

Computation Units {#computation}
Each transaction is assigned a number of computation units based on complexity.

Sui uses a bucketed model, grouping similar transactions into the same unit cost:

Computation Cost (CU) | Range | Example
1,000 CU | 0–1,000 | Very light transaction
5,000 CU | 1,001–5,000 | Slightly complex
... | ... | ...
5,000,000 CU | 1,000,001–5,000,000 | Heavy computation
Abort | >5,000,000 | Exceeds limits

Why buckets?

Prevents "gas golfing" (over-optimizing code for small savings).

Allows the gas metering system to evolve without disrupting developers.

 Storage Units {#storage}
Storage units depend on how much new data is written to chain. The rule:

1 byte = 100 storage units

So:

25 bytes = 2,500 units

75 bytes = 7,500 units

Sui’s storage fund model charges storage fees upfront but rebates 99% if the data is later deleted.

Gas Budgets {#gas-budgets}
Every transaction includes a gas budget—the maximum gas you’re willing to pay.

A transaction is accepted only if:

gas_budget >= max(computation_fees, total_gas_fees)

What if it’s too low?
If the gas budget < computation_fees → the entire budget is charged, and the transaction fails.

If gas budget is enough for computation but not storage → computation fees and mutation costs are charged.

The minimum gas budget is 2,000 MIST (0.000002 SUI).
The maximum is 50 billion MIST (50 SUI).

| Description | Gas price | Compute CU | Storage price | Storage units | Rebate | Min budget | Net fees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic transaction, 10 bytes storage | 1,000 MIST | 1,000 | 75 MIST | 1,000 | 0 MIST | 1,075,000 MIST | 1,075,000 MIST |
Same tx + deletion | 500 | 1,000 | 75 | 1,000 | 100K | 500K | 475K
Complex tx, 120 bytes | 1,000 | 5,000 | 200 | 12,000 | 0 | 7.4M | 7.4M
Same tx + deletion (huge rebate) | 500 | 5,000 | 200 | 12,000 | 5M | 2.5M | -100K
