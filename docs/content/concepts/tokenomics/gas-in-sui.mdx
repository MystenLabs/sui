A Sui transaction pays for both the **computation cost** of execution and the **storage cost** of objects it creates or mutates.  

The total gas fee is:

```
total_gas_fees = computation_units * reference_gas_price + storage_units * storage_price
```

When a transaction deletes stored objects, you receive a **storage rebate**. Your net gas fees are:

```
net_gas_fees = computation_gas_fee + storage_gas_fee - storage_rebate
```

You can view these values in a Sui explorer for each transaction.

## Gas prices {#gas-prices}

- The **reference gas price** measures the cost of executing a transaction. Validators update this value at the end of each epoch.  
- The **storage price** measures the cost of storing data on chain. This value updates less frequently and often stays constant for several epochs.  

---

## Gas units {#gas-units}

Gas units measure how much computation and storage your transaction uses:

- [Computation units](#computation)  
- [Storage units](#storage)  

### Computation units {#computation}

Sui uses a **bucketed schedule** for computation. Transactions in the same bucket cost the same number of units.

- Buckets range from **1,000 units** to **5,000,000 units**.  
- Transactions needing more than 5,000,000 units abort.  

This schedule prevents gas golfing (micro-optimizations for fees) and lets the network adjust costs without disrupting developers.

| Bucket Lower Threshold | Bucket Upper Threshold | Computation Units |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0                      | 1,000                  | 1,000            |
| 1,001                  | 5,000                  | 5,000            |
| 5,001                  | 10,000                 | 10,000           |
| 10,001                 | 20,000                 | 20,000           |
| 20,001                 | 50,000                 | 50,000           |
| 50,001                 | 200,000                | 200,000          |
| 200,001                | 1,000,000              | 1,000,000        |
| 1,000,001              | 5,000,000              | 5,000,000        |
| 5,000,001              | Infinity               | abort            |

### Storage units {#storage}

Sui maps each byte stored on chain into 100 storage units.  

Examples:  
- 25 bytes = 2,500 units  
- 75 bytes = 7,500 units  

The [storage fund](../tokenomics.mdx#storage-fund) model requires you to pay up front for storage in perpetuity:  

- **99%** of fees are rebateable when you delete data.  
- **1%** of fees are non-rebateable.

## Gas budgets {#gas-budgets}

Every transaction must include a **gas budget**. Your budget must be at least as large as the greater of:  

```
max{computation_fees, total_gas_fees}
```

If your budget is too low:  
- If it is less than computation fees, the entire budget is charged.  
- If it covers computation but not total fees, the budget pays computation and mutation costs, but the transaction fails.  

**Limits:**  
- Minimum gas budget: **2,000 MIST (0.000002 SUI)**  
- Maximum gas budget: **50,000,000,000 MIST (50 SUI)**  

These limits protect validators from spam and overflow attacks.

## Gas budget examples {#gas-budget-examples}

The following table shows how fees, rebates, and budgets interact. Transactions in the same computation bucket pay the same number of units. Large rebates can reduce — or even reverse — net fees.

| Transaction type                                      | Ref Gas Price | Comp Units | Storage Price | Storage Units | Storage Rebate | Min Gas Budget | Net Gas Fees |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Simple: store 10 bytes                                | 1,000 MIST    | 1,000       | 75 MIST       | 1,000         | 0 MIST         | 1,075,000 MIST  | 1,075,000 MIST |
| Simple: store 10 bytes and delete data                | 500 MIST      | 1,000       | 75 MIST       | 1,000         | 100,000 MIST   | 500,000 MIST    | 475,000 MIST   |

| Complex: store 120 bytes and delete data (large rebate) | 500 MIST      | 5,000       | 200 MIST      | 12,000        | 5,000,000 MIST | 2,500,000 MIST  | -100,000 MIST  |
