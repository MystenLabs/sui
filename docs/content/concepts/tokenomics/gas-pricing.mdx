Sui gas pricing is designed to achieve three outcomes:

- Deliver **low, predictable fees**  
- Incentivize validators to **optimize transaction processing**  
- Protect against **denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**

Because validators agree on a **network-wide reference price** at the start of each epoch, you can submit transactions with confidence that they will be processed at fair rates. The mechanism also rewards good validator behavior and aligns incentives between token holders, validators, and users.

A unique feature of Sui gas is that you pay **separate fees** for computation and storage. For a transaction `τ`:

```
gas_fees[τ] = computation_units[τ] * computation_price[τ] + storage_units[τ] * storage_price
```

- `computation_units[τ]` = resources needed to execute the transaction  
- `storage_units[τ]` = resources needed to store the transaction’s data  
- `computation_price[τ]` = cost of computation in SUI  
- `storage_price` = cost of storage in SUI  

Because prices are separated from units, the mechanism remains stable even as the SUI market price changes.


## Computation gas prices {#computation}

The computation gas price measures the cost of one unit of computation in SUI. It is set at the **transaction level** and submitted by you as the gas price. Conceptually, it has two parts:

```
computation_price[τ] = reference_price + tip[τ]
```

- **Reference price**: a network-wide value that stays constant during each epoch.  
- **Tip**: an optional extra amount you can add to prioritize your transaction during congestion.  

Most transactions run without tips. You usually set the computation price equal to the current reference price.

### How the reference price is set

Validators update the reference price at the start of each epoch using three steps:

1. **Gas price survey**  
   - Each validator submits its minimum acceptable price.  
   - The protocol orders these and picks the 2/3 stake-weighted percentile as the reference price.  
   - This ensures that a quorum of validators is willing to process transactions at that level.

2. **Tallying rule**  
   - During the epoch, validators monitor each other’s behavior.  
   - Each validator assigns reward multipliers based on performance.  
   - Validators that honor the reference price receive boosts, while others receive penalties.  

3. **Stake reward adjustment**  
   - At epoch end, reward distribution is adjusted using the multipliers.  
   - Good validators earn their normal rewards.  
   - Poor performers have rewards slashed.  

This system incentivizes validators to both set low reference prices and honor them. If a validator sets its reservation price too low and cannot honor it, it gets penalized. If it sets it too high, it risks losing stake to more efficient competitors.

## Storage gas prices {#storage}

The storage gas price measures the cost of storing one unit of data in perpetuity, in SUI.  

- Storage prices are **fixed** and updated infrequently through governance proposals.  
- Updates reflect the **real-world dollar cost of storage**, adjusted for changes in SUI’s market price or improvements in storage technology.  
- Storage fees go into the [storage fund](../tokenomics.mdx#storage-fund) and are later redistributed to validators.  

## Gas as a coordination mechanism {#coordination-mechanism}

The gas pricing system gives you credible reference prices:

- Use the **reference computation price** for execution.  
- Use the **storage price** for storage.  

Together, these values ensure that your transactions are processed in a timely and predictable way.  

During high demand:  
- Validators can scale horizontally by adding workers, keeping prices low.  
- If scaling cannot keep up, the tip mechanism applies congestion pricing to discourage excess demand.  

In the long run, this system creates strong incentives:  
- Validators that optimize hardware and operations can honor lower gas prices and attract more stake.  
- Inefficient validators get priced out or penalized.  
- End users benefit from **lower, fairer fees** and a more efficient network.
