title: SUI Bridging
description: Moving tokens from one blockchain to another is called bridging. To bridge tokens from another blockchain to Sui, you can use the Sui Bridge, Wormhole Connect, or Wormhole Portal Bridge.

Bridging is the process of moving tokens from one blockchain to another. When you use a bridge to move tokens between blockchains that are incompatible, the tokens are wrapped and converted to a derivative token for the target blockchain. You can transfer tokens from other blockchains to Sui, or transfer SUI tokens to other blockchains.

Sui supports bridging through [Sui Bridge](#sui-bridge), [Wormhole Connect](#wormhole-connect), and [Wormhole Portal Bridge](#wormhole-portal-bridge).

## Sui Bridge

Sui Bridge is the native bridge for the Sui network. It is built into the core architecture of Sui, providing optimal integration and operation. Sui Bridge enables the movement of digital assets between Sui and other blockchains, preserving security and maintaining interoperability. It supports secure and efficient transfer of native and wrapped ETH to and from Sui. Sui Bridge leverages Sui’s capabilities to offer fast transactions, lower costs, and a decentralized architecture.

You can bridge tokens at [bridge.sui.io](https://bridge.sui.io/).

### Operation and governance

Sui Bridge is operated and governed by Sui validators, the same set that secures the Sui network. Bridge transfers and other actions require validator signatures with a threshold of voting power. Governance is handled by validator voting.

To learn how to set up a Sui Bridge full node, see [Sui Bridge Validator Node Configuration](../../guides/operator/bridge-node-configuration.mdx).

### Supported chains and tokens

Sui Bridge supports bridging between Sui and other networks with the following assets:

| Asset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Wrapped Bitcoin | Tokenized representation of Bitcoin. |
| Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC) | Decentralized Internet-of-value protocol for global payments. |
| Ethereum (ETH) | Native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. |
| Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) | Tokenized representation of native ETH. |
| Tether (USDT) | Stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. |

### Global limiter {#global-limiter}

A limiter protects funds by constraining the total value of assets leaving Sui Bridge in a 24-hour window. It tracks value hourly and aggregates from the last 24 hours, refreshing every hour.  

The limit applies globally and varies by direction (Ethereum → Sui vs. Sui → Ethereum). It also caps the maximum single transfer.  

Limits are set by validator committee vote and announced in the [mn-validator-announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1093852827627040768) on Discord.  

The global limit is currently $16 million from Ethereum to Sui and $7 million from Sui to Ethereum per 24 hours.

### Asset price

Sui Bridge v1 uses static pricing to calculate limits. ETH is priced at $2,600. One ETH consumes $2,600 of the limit. The validator committee governs pricing through voting.

### Transfer limit

There is no minimum transfer, but very small fractions can be rounded down. For ETH and WETH, reduced precision of eight decimals rounds 10.0000000000000001 down to 10.  

| Token | Minimal value | 
| --- | --- |
| ETH | 0.00000001 ETH |
| WETH | 0.00000001 ETH |

The maximum transfer equals the global USD limit. See [Global limiter](#global-limiter).

## Wormhole Connect {#wormhole-connect}

Wormhole Connect lets you bridge tokens from any supported Wormhole chain into Sui, with an extra drop of SUI for gas fees. Developers can also embed Connect in their own websites and dApps.

See [Cross-Chain Token Transfers with Wormhole Connect](https://wormhole.com/docs/tutorials/messaging/sui-connect/) on the Wormhole website for a tutorial.

### Wormhole Connect asset support {#asset-support}

Wormhole Connect supports lock-and-mint bridging for ETH, WETH, USDC, MATIC, WMATIC, BNB, WBNB, AVAX, WAVAX, FTM, WFTM, CELO, GLMR, WGLRM, and SOL across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Celo, Moonbeam, Solana, and Sui. Bridged tokens are received as Wormhole-minted tokens on the destination chain. See the [Wormhole token list](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-token-list). Some tokens support swapping on destination DEXs.

### Wormhole Connect automatic relay {#automatic-relay}

On EVM chains and Sui, Wormhole Connect can pay destination-chain gas automatically. Users only pay gas on the source chain.

### Wormhole Connect gas drop-off {#gas-drop-off}

Users can pay an extra fee on the source chain to receive a small amount of native gas on the destination chain. For example, bridging USDC from Ethereum to Sui can include a fee in USDC to receive SUI for gas. This feature is supported on EVM chains and Sui.  

See the [Wormhole FAQ](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/faqs) for details.

## Wormhole Portal Bridge

The [Portal Bridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/sui), powered by Wormhole, supports bridging assets from any of the [22 supported Wormhole chains](https://www.wormhole.com/network).
