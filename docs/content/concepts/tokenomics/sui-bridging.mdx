Bridging is the process of moving tokens from one blockchain to another. When you bridge tokens across incompatible chains, the tokens are **wrapped** into a derivative token on the destination chain.  

You can bridge tokens into Sui or transfer SUI out to other blockchains. Sui supports bridging through:  

- [Sui Bridge](#sui-bridge)  
- [Wormhole Connect](#wormhole-connect)  
- [Wormhole Portal Bridge](#wormhole-portal-bridge)  

## Sui Bridge

Sui Bridge is the **native bridge** for the Sui network, built directly into the protocol. It enables secure transfer of digital assets between Sui and other chains, with validator-governed operations.  

Key benefits:  
- Secure and efficient transfers of native and wrapped ETH to and from Sui  
- Fast transaction speeds and low costs  
- Governance and validation by the same committee that secures Sui  

You can bridge tokens using the official site: [bridge.sui.io](https://bridge.sui.io).  

### Operation and governance

Sui Bridge is operated by **Sui validators**. All bridge actions require validator signatures above a threshold of voting power. Governance, like the network itself, happens through validator voting.  

See [Sui Bridge Validator Node Configuration](../../guides/operator/bridge-node-configuration.mdx) to set up a full bridge node.

### Global limiter {#global-limiter}

To protect funds, a **24-hour limit** caps the value of assets that can leave the bridge.  

- Values refresh hourly  
- Limits apply globally per route (e.g., Ethereum → Sui differs from Sui → Ethereum)  
- Single transfers cannot exceed the limit  

Validator committees govern these limits through voting. Announcements are made in the [mn-validator-announcements Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1093852827627040768).  

Current limits:  
- $16M from Ethereum → Sui  
- $7M from Sui → Ethereum  

### Asset price

Sui Bridge v1 uses **static pricing** for limit calculations. ETH is priced at **$2,600** for this purpose.  

Pricing is validator-governed and works with the global limiter to protect funds.  

### Transfer limits

- **Minimum**: 0.00000001 ETH or WETH (8 decimal precision)  
- **Maximum**: The global USD limit per route  

Values smaller than 1e-8 ETH or WETH are rounded down.  

## Wormhole Connect {#wormhole-connect}

Wormhole Connect provides simple bridging into Sui with added features:  

- **Automatic relay**: Pay gas only on the source chain (supported on EVM and Sui).  
- **Gas drop-off**: Pay a small fee on the source chain to receive native SUI for gas on the destination chain.  
- **Developer integration**: dApps can embed Wormhole Connect directly.

### Supported assets

ETH, WETH, USDC, MATIC, WMATIC, BNB, WBNB, AVAX, WAVAX, FTM, WFTM, CELO, GLMR, WGLRM, SOL across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Celo, Moonbeam, Solana, and Sui.  

Tokens are received as **Wormhole-minted tokens** on the destination chain. In some cases these are canonical representations. See the [Wormhole token list](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-token-list).  

## Wormhole Portal Bridge

The [Portal Bridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/sui), powered by Wormhole, supports bridging **any asset** across the [22 Wormhole-supported chains](https://www.wormhole.com/network).
