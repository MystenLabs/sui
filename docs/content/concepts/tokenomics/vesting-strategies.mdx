If you plan to launch a token on Sui, you may want to implement a vesting strategy. Vesting releases tokens to team members, investors, or other early stakeholders over time rather than all at once.  

Publishing and implementing vesting details helps:  

- Ensure long-term commitment  
- Prevent large market dumps  
- Reduce fears of rug pulls  
- Align stakeholder incentives with project success  

## Vesting options

The right vesting model depends on your project goals. Below are common strategies, each with examples and reference smart contracts.  

### Cliff vesting

All tokens unlock at once after a set period (the **cliff**). Before the cliff, no tokens are available.  

:::info Example
Each of 10 employees is granted 1,000 tokens with a one-year cliff. After one year, each employee receives the full 1,000 tokens.  
:::

Smart contract: [`cliff.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/sources/cliff.move)  

### Graded vesting

Tokens unlock gradually over time, often in equal portions.  

:::info Example
An employee receives 1,200 tokens, with 300 tokens vesting every year over four years.  
:::

Implemented in the [hybrid vesting example](#hybrid-vesting).  

### Hybrid vesting

Combines different models (e.g., cliff + graded).  

:::info Example
50% of tokens unlock after a one-year cliff. The remaining 50% unlock linearly over three years.  
:::

Smart contract: [`hybrid.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/sources/hybrid.move)  

### Backloaded vesting

Most tokens unlock near the end of the vesting period. This rewards long-term commitment.  

:::info Example
- 10% of tokens unlock during the first three years  
- 90% unlock in the fourth year  
:::

Smart contract: [`backloaded.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/sources/backloaded.move)  

### Milestone- or performance-based vesting {#milestone}

Tokens unlock when specific goals or milestones are achieved.  

:::info Examples
- Tokens vest as monthly active users (MAUs) increase, with full vesting at 10 million MAUs.  
- Tokens unlock when a project launches on Mainnet.  
:::

Smart contract: [`milestone.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/sources/milestone.move)  

### Linear vesting

Tokens unlock gradually and continuously over a set period.  

:::info Example
An employee receives 1,000 tokens that vest linearly over one year.  
:::

Smart contract: [`linear.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/sources/linear.move)  

### Immediate vesting

All tokens unlock immediately. While this can be done with a simple transfer, a smart contract provides transparency, auditability, and flexibility for conditions.  

:::info Example
An investor receives their full token allocation at purchase.  
:::

Test example (using the linear contract with duration set to 0): [`immediate_tests.move`](../../../../examples/vesting/tests/immediate_tests.move)
