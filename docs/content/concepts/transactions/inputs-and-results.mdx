Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) operate on inputs and produce results. Inputs are the values you provide to the PTB, either objects on the network or pure values like numbers and strings. Results are the values that PTB commands produce, which subsequent commands in the same transaction can use. Together, inputs and results form the data flow through a PTB's execution.

## Inputs 

Input arguments to a PTB are broadly categorized as either objects or pure values. The direct implementation of these arguments is often obscured by transaction builders or SDKs. Each `Input` is either an object, `Input::Object(ObjectArg)`, which contains the necessary metadata to specify the object being used, or a pure value, `Input::Pure(PureArg)`, which contains the bytes of the value.

For object inputs, the metadata needed differs depending on the type of [ownership of the object](/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership.mdx). The data for the `ObjectArg` enum follows:

- If the object is owned by an address or it is immutable, then use `ObjectArg::ImmOrOwnedObject(ObjectID, SequenceNumber, ObjectDigest)`. The triple respectively specifies the object's ID, its sequence or version number, and the digest of the object's data.

- If an object is shared, then use `ObjectArg::SharedObject { id: ObjectID, initial_shared_version: SequenceNumber, mutable: bool }`. Unlike `ImmOrOwnedObject`, a shared object's version and digest are determined by the network's consensus protocol. The `initial_shared_version` is the version of the object when it was first shared, which is used by consensus when it has not yet seen a transaction with that object. While all shared objects can be mutated, the `mutable` flag indicates whether the object is to be used mutably in this transaction. In the case where the `mutable` flag is set to `false`, the object is read-only and the system can schedule other read-only transactions in parallel.

- If the object is owned by another object, as in it was sent to an object's ID through the `TransferObjects` command or the `sui::transfer::transfer` function, then use `ObjectArg::Receiving(ObjectID, SequenceNumber, ObjectDigest)`. The object data is the same as for the `ImmOrOwnedObject` case.

For pure inputs, the only data provided is the [BCS](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/std/bcs.md) bytes, which are deserialized to construct Move values. Not all Move values can be constructed from BCS bytes. The following types are allowed to be used with pure values:

- All primitive types: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`, `bool`, `address`.

- A string, either an ASCII string `std::ascii::String` or UTF8 string `std::string::String`. In either case, the bytes are verified to be a valid string with the respective encoding.

- An object ID `sui::object::ID`.

- A vector, `vector<T>`, where `T` is a valid type for a pure input, checked recursively.

- An option, `std::option::Option<T>`, where `T` is a valid type for a pure input, checked recursively.

Bytes are not validated until the type is specified in a command, for example in `MoveCall` or `MakeMoveVec`. This means that a given pure input could be used to instantiate Move values of several types.

## Results

Each transaction command produces an array of values. The array can be empty. The type of the value can be any arbitrary Move type, so unlike inputs, the values are not limited to objects or pure values. The number of results generated and their types are specific to each transaction command:

- `MoveCall`: The number of results and their types are determined by the Move function being called. Move functions that return references are not supported at this time.

- `SplitCoins`: Produces one or more coins from a single coin. The type of each coin is `sui::coin::Coin<T>` where the specific coin type `T` matches the coin being split.

- `Publish`: Returns the upgrade capability `sui::package::UpgradeCap` for the newly published package.

- `Upgrade`: Returns the upgrade receipt `sui::package::UpgradeReceipt` for the upgraded package.

- `TransferObjects` and `MergeCoins` produce an empty result vector.
