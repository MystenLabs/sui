title: Get Started Building on Sui
---

Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform because it's purposefully built to addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption. If you are coming from another blockchain, you will notice features unique to Sui that address the needs of building in Web3:

- **Object data model:** {@include: ./snippets/object-model-ovr.mdx}
- **zkLogin and zkSend SDK:** With zkLogin you can send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential (like Apple, Google, or others) without publicly linking the two. With the zkSend SDK, you can integrate Stashed wallet with your dApp.  
- **Dynamic fields:** The Sui object model includes dynamic fields and dynamic object fields that enable you to add and remove objects as fields to other objects.
- **Programmable transaction blocks:** Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) are atomic batches of transactions that provide efficient and economical execution of smart contract logic.
- **Move to app compiler:** Go directly from Move code to a working app.

Before you can take advantage of Sui benefits, you need to install its binaries. 

## Install Sui 

{@include: ./snippets/quick-install.mdx}

You can also install Sui from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install Sui page.

Go to [Install Sui](./get-started/sui-install.mdx).

## After installing Sui

After you have Sui installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts. 

- [Connect to a Sui Network](./get-started/connect.mdx)
- [Get Sui Address](./get-started/get-address.mdx)
- [Get SUI Coins](./get-started/get-coins.mdx)

## GraphQL queries

Use the GraphQL service for Sui RPC to interact with on-chain data. 

Go to [Query Sui RPC with GraphQL](./get-started/graphql-rpc.mdx).
