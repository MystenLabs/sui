title: Advanced Topics

Information in the Advanced Topics section covers coding practices, useful features, and other developer-focused considerations that might arise as you continue your development journey on Sui. The topics in this section aren't necessarily more difficult than other topics, but they include subjects you might not encounter or need to consider until you're developing more advanced solutions on the Sui network.

## Custom Indexer

You can build custom indexers using the Sui micro-data ingestion framework. To create an indexer, you subscribe to a checkpoint stream with full checkpoint content. Establishing a custom indexer helps improve latency, allows pruning the data of your Sui Full node, and provides efficient assemblage of checkpoint data.

Go to [Custom Indexer](./advanced/custom-indexer.mdx).

## Migrating to GraphQL
