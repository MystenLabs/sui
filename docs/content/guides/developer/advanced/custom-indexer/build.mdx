:::

To build a complete custom indexer, you use the `sui-indexer-alt-framework`. The steps that follow demonstrate how to create both sequential and concurrent pipelines that extract transaction digests from Sui checkpoints and store them in a local PostgreSQL. You can find the [source code for the framework](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-indexer-alt-framework) in the Sui repo on GitHub.

The guide covers:
- **Sequential pipeline**: Processes and commits checkpoints in strict order
- **Concurrent pipeline**: Processes checkpoints in parallel while ensuring batches are committed in order for higher throughput

:::tip

While this example uses PostgreSQL with [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started) (a popular Rust ORM and query builder) for minimalism and out-of-the-box support, the `sui-indexer-alt-framework` is designed for flexible storage. You can use different databases (such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), or similar) or utilize other database clients if you prefer not to use Diesel. To achieve this, implement the framework's `Store` and `Connection` traits and define your database write logic directly within your `Handler::commit()` method.

## What you build

The following steps show how to create an indexer with multiple pipeline types:

- Connects to Sui Testnet: Uses the remote checkpoint store at https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io.
- Processes checkpoints: Streams checkpoint data continuously.
- Extracts transaction data: Pulls transaction digests from each checkpoint.
- Stores in local PostgreSQL: Commits data to a local PostgreSQL database.
- Implements multiple handler patterns:
  - **Sequential handler**: Guarantees each checkpoint is processed and committed in order
  - **Concurrent handler**: Allows batches of checkpoints to process in parallel while ensuring commits are ordered

In the end, you have a working indexer that demonstrates all core framework concepts and can serve as a foundation for more complex custom indexers.

:::info

Sui provides checkpoint stores for both Mainnet and Testnet.

- Testnet: `https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io`
- Mainnet: `https://checkpoints.mainnet.sui.io`

:::

## Choosing a pipeline type

The framework supports two pipeline architectures:

- **Sequential**: Processes and commits each checkpoint in strict order. Choose this when ordering guarantees are essential or when you're just getting started.
- **Concurrent**: Processes batches of checkpoints in parallel for higher throughput, but relaxes ordering guarantees.

This guide demonstrates both patterns using the same transaction digest extraction example.

##step Project setup

First, open your console to the directory you want to store your indexer project. Use the `cargo new` command to create a new Rust project and then navigate to its directory.

```sh
$ cargo new simple-sui-indexer
$ cd simple-sui-indexer
```

##step Configure dependencies

Replace your `Cargo.toml` code with the following configuration and save.

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/Cargo.toml" mode="code" />

The manifest now includes the following dependencies:

- `sui-indexer-alt-framework`: Core framework providing pipeline infrastructure.
- `diesel/diesel-async`: Type-safe database ORM with asynchronous support.
- `tokio`: Async runtime required by the framework.
- `clap`: Command-line argument parsing for configuration.
- `anyhow`: Error handling and async-trait for trait implementations.
- `dotenvy`: Ingest `.env` file that stores your PostgreSQL URL.

##step Create database

Before configuring migrations, create and verify your local PostgreSQL database:

```sh
$ createdb sui_indexer
```

Get your connection details:

```sh
$ psql sui_indexer -c "\conninfo"
```

If successful, your console should display a message similar to the following:

```sh
You are connected to database "sui_indexer" as user "username" via socket in "/tmp" at port "5432".
```

If you receive a `createdb` error similar to

```sh
createdb: error: connection to server on socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  role "username" does not exist
```

This means you need to create the user (replace `username` with the name provided in your error message).

```sh
$ sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser username
```

Enter the password for your pgAdmin account when prompted, then try the `createdb` command again.

You can now set a variable to your database URL as it's used in following commands. Make sure to change `username` to your actual username.

```sh
$ PSQL_URL=postgres://username@localhost:5432/sui_indexer
```

You can now test your connection with the following command:

```sh
$ psql $PSQL_URL -c "SELECT 'Connected';"
```

If successful, your console or terminal should respond with a message similar to the following:

```sh
?column?
-----------
 Connected
(1 row)
```

##step Database setup

Before you start coding, make sure you set up a local PostgreSQL database from the previous step. This is required for the indexer to store the extracted transaction data.

The following database setup steps have you:

1. Create a database table to store the data.
1. Use Diesel to manage the process.
1. Generate Rust code that maps to the database table.

###substep Configure Diesel

First, create a `diesel.toml` file (within the same folder as `cargo.toml`) to configure database migrations.

```sh
$ touch diesel.toml
```

Update and save the file with the following code:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/diesel.toml" mode="code" />

###substep Create database table using Diesel migrations

Diesel migrations are a way of creating and managing database tables using SQL files. Each migration has two files:

- `up.sql`: Creates and changes the table.
- `down.sql`: Removes and undoes the changes.

Use the `diesel setup` command to create the necessary directory structure, passing your database URL with the `--database-url` argument.

```sh
$ diesel setup --database-url $PSQL_URL
```

Use the `diesel migration` command at the root of your project to then generate the migration files.

```sh
$ diesel migration generate transaction_digests
```

You should now have a `migrations` folder in your project. There should be a subdirectory in this folder with the name format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_transaction_digests`. This folder should contain the `up.sql` and `down.sql` files.

Open `up.sql` and replace its contents with the following code (using the actual folder name):

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_transaction_digests/up.sql" mode="code" />

:::tip

This example uses the `TEXT` data type for `tx_digest`, but best practice for a production indexer is to use the `BYTEA` data type.

The `TEXT` type is used to make the transaction digest easily readable and directly usable with external tools. Digests are `Base58` encoded, and because PostgreSQL cannot natively display `BYTEA` data in this format, storing it as `TEXT` allows you to copy the digest from a query and paste it into an explorer like [SuiScan](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/home).

For a production environment, however, `BYTEA` is strongly recommended. It offers superior storage and query efficiency by storing the raw byte representation, which is more compact and significantly faster for comparisons than a string. Refer to [Binary data performance in PostgreSQL](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/binary-data-performance-in-postgresql/) on the CYBERTEC website for more information.

:::

Save `up.sql`, then open `down.sql` to edit. Replace the contents of the file with the following code and save it:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_transaction_digests/down.sql" mode="code" />

###substep Apply migration and generate Rust schema

From the root of your project, use the `diesel migration` command to create tables.

```sh
$ diesel migration run --database-url $PSQL_URL
```

Then use the `diesel print-schema` command to generate the `schema.rs` file from the actual database.

```sh
$ diesel print-schema --database-url $PSQL_URL > src/schema.rs
```

Your `src/schema.rs` file should now look like the following:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/schema.rs" mode="code" />

After running the previous commands, your project is set up for the next steps:

- PostgreSQL now has a `transaction_digests` table with the defined columns.
- `src/schema.rs` contains automatically generated Rust code that represents this table structure.
- You can now write type-safe Rust code that talks to this specific table.

The Diesel's migration system evolves the database schema over time in a structured and version-controlled way. For a complete walkthrough, see the official Diesel [Getting Started guide](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started).

##step Create data structure

To simplify writes to Diesel, you can define a struct that represents a record on the `transaction_digests` table.

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/models.rs" mode="code" />

Key annotations:

- `FieldCount`: Required by `sui-indexer-alt-framework` for memory optimization and batch processing efficiency. It is used to limit the max size of a batch so that we don't exceed the postgres limit on the number of bind parameters a single SQL statement can have.
- `diesel(table_name = transaction_digests)`: Maps this Rust struct to the `transaction_digests` table, whose schema is generated in a previous step.
- `Insertable`: Allows this struct to be inserted into the database using Diesel.

##step Define the sequential handler struct

Create a `handlers.rs` file in your `src` directory to implement your sequential handler.

```sh
$ touch ./src/handlers.rs
```

Open the file and define a concrete struct to implement the `Processor` and `Handler` traits:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers.rs" mode="code" struct="TransactionDigestHandler" />

Save the file but keep it open as the next steps add to its code.

##step Implement the `Processor`

The `Processor` trait defines how to extract and transform data from checkpoints. The resulting data is then passed to `Handler::commit`.

Add the necessary dependencies at the top of the file.

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers.rs" mode="code" tag="processordeps" />

After the `TransactionDigestHandler` struct, add the `Processor` code:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers.rs" mode="code" tag="processor" />

Key concepts:

- `NAME`: Unique identifier for this processor used in monitoring and logging.
- `type Value`: Defines what data flows through the pipeline, which ensures type safety.
- `process()`: Core logic that transforms checkpoint data into your custom data structure.

Save the `handlers.rs` file.

</summary>
  
<ImportContent source="crates/sui-indexer-alt-framework/src/pipeline/processor.rs" mode="code" trait="Processor" />
  
</details>

##step Implement the sequential `Handler`

The sequential `Handler` trait defines how to commit data to the database. Append the `Handler` dependencies to bottom of the dependency list you created in the previous step.

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers.rs" mode="code" tag="handlerdeps" />

Add the logic for `Handler` after the `Processor` code. The complete code is available at the end of this step.

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers.rs" mode="code" tag="handler" />

How sequential batching works:

1. `process()` returns values for each checkpoint.
1. `batch()` receives an iterator and must consume all values from it, accumulating them across multiple checkpoints.
1. `commit()` writes the batch when the framework reaches limits (`H::MAX_BATCH_CHECKPOINTS`).

Sequential handlers guarantee strict checkpoint ordering by consuming entire iterators—they cannot implement custom batching logic.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-indexer-alt-framework/src/pipeline/sequential/committer.rs" mode="code" tag="batch" />

:::tip

You can override the default batch limits by implementing constants in your `Handler`.

</details>

##step Implement a concurrent handler (optional)

For higher throughput, you can implement a concurrent handler that processes batches of checkpoints in parallel. Create a new file `handlers_concurrent_generic.rs` in your `src` directory:

```sh
$ touch ./src/handlers_concurrent_generic.rs
```

The concurrent handler uses the same `Processor` trait but a different `Handler` trait from `pipeline::concurrent`:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_generic.rs" mode="code" tag="imports" />

Implement the same `Processor` logic:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_generic.rs" mode="code" tag="processor" />

Now implement the concurrent `Handler` trait:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_generic.rs" mode="code" tag="handler" />

Key differences from sequential handlers:

- **`BatchStatus`**: Return `Pending` to continue accumulating values, or `Ready` to signal the batch should be committed. Returning `Pending` for all batches lets the framework decide when to commit based on `MIN_EAGER_ROWS` and `MAX_PENDING_ROWS`.
- **Custom batching logic**: Concurrent handlers can implement custom batching by conditionally returning `Ready` based on batch size or other criteria, enabling finer control over commit behavior.

The concurrent handler processes checkpoints in parallel while the framework ensures commits happen in order.

##step PostgreSQL concurrent handler (recommended for concurrent + PostgreSQL)

If you're using PostgreSQL with concurrent pipelines, the framework provides a specialized handler trait that simplifies the implementation and automatically manages PostgreSQL's parameter count limit (32,767 parameters per query).

Create a new file `handlers_concurrent_postgres.rs`:

```sh
$ touch ./src/handlers_concurrent_postgres.rs
```

Add the imports:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_postgres.rs" mode="code" tag="imports" />

Use the same `Processor` implementation:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_postgres.rs" mode="code" tag="processor" />

Implement the PostgreSQL `Handler` trait—notice how much simpler it is:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/handlers_concurrent_postgres.rs" mode="code" tag="handler" />

Benefits of the PostgreSQL handler:

- **No `type Store` or `type Batch` needed**: The trait provides these automatically.
- **No `batch()` method**: The framework handles batching based on your `Value` type's `FieldCount`.
- **Automatic parameter limit enforcement**: Prevents exceeding PostgreSQL's 32,767 parameter limit.
- **Simpler API**: Just implement `commit()` with your insert logic.

The PostgreSQL handler is a blanket implementation over the generic concurrent handler, so you get all the concurrent benefits with less code.

##step Create `.env` file

The main function you create in the next step needs the value you stored to the shell variable `$PSQL_URL`. To make it available, create a `.env` file with that data.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bash/zsh" value="bash">
  
```sh
echo "DATABASE_URL=$PSQL_URL" > .env
```
  
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="fish" value="fish">

echo "DATABASE_URL=$PSQL_URL" > .env

<TabItem label="PowerShell" value="powershell">
  
```sh
"DATABASE_URL=$env:PSQL_URL" | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 .env
```
  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After running the command for your environment, make sure the `.env` file exists at your project root with the correct data.

##step Create main function and register your handler

Now, to tie everything together in the main function, open your `main.rs` file. The setup is the same regardless of which handler type you use:

<ImportContent source="examples/rust/basic-sui-indexer/src/main.rs" mode="code" />

To register a different handler type, replace the `sequential_pipeline()` line with one of the following:

**For sequential handler (shown above):**
```rust
cluster.sequential_pipeline(TransactionDigestHandler)
    .run()
    .await?;
```

**For concurrent handler (generic):**
```rust
cluster.concurrent_pipeline(ConcurrentTransactionDigestHandler)
    .run()
    .await?;
```

**For concurrent handler (PostgreSQL):**
```rust
cluster.concurrent_pipeline(PostgresTransactionDigestHandler)
    .run()
    .await?;
```

Key components:

- `embed_migrations!`: Includes migration files in the binary for automatic schema updates.
- `IndexerCluster::builder()`: Sets up framework infrastructure (database connections, checkpoint streaming, monitoring).
- `sequential_pipeline()` / `concurrent_pipeline()`: Registers your handler with the appropriate pipeline type.
- `cluster.run()`: Starts processing checkpoints.

Your indexer is now complete. The next steps walk you through running it and verifying results.

##step Run your indexer

Use the `cargo run` command to run your indexer against Testnet with remote checkpoint storage.

```sh
$ cargo run -- --remote-store-url https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io
```

:::info

Allow incoming network requests if your operating system requests it for the `basic-sui-indexer` application.

:::

If successful, your console informs you that the indexer is running.

##step Verify results

Open a new terminal or console and connect to your database to check the results:

```bash
$ psql sui_indexer
```

After connecting, run a few queries to verify your indexer is working:

Check how many transaction digests are indexed:

```sql
$ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transaction_digests;
```

View sample records:

```sql
$ SELECT * FROM transaction_digests LIMIT 5;
```

To confirm your data is accurate, copy any transaction digest from your database and verify it on SuiScan: [https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/home](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/home)

You've built a working custom indexer. 🎉 

The key concepts covered here apply to any custom indexer: define your data structure, implement the `Processor` and `Handler` traits, and let the framework handle the infrastructure.
