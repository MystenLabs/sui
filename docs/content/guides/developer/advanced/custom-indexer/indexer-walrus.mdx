:::tip

This topic examines how to use a custom indexer with Walrus. For a more in-depth look at creating a custom indexer, see [Build Your First Custom Indexer](../custom-indexer.mdx). 

:::

You can use the [custom indexer framework](/concepts/custom-indexing-framework) to provide additional functionality on top of the Walrus protocol. Walrus is a decentralized storage and data availability protocol designed specifically for large binary files, or blobs. 

Walrus is a content-addressable storage protocol, where data is identified and retrieved using a unique identifier derived from the content itself, rather than from a file path or location. Consequently, if different users upload the same content, then Walrus reuses the existing blob rather than creating a new one. 

For uniqueness, each blob uploaded to Walrus also creates a corresponding [`Blob` NFT object on Sui](https://docs.wal.app/dev-guide/sui-struct.html#blob-and-storage-objects) with a unique ID. Furthermore, the associated `Blob` object can optionally have a `Metadata` [dynamic field](../../../../concepts/dynamic-fields.mdx) (key-value extensions to on-chain objects that extend an object's data at runtime). If set, this dynamic field acts as [a mapping of key-value attribute pairs](https://docs.wal.app/usage/client-cli.html?highlight=attribute#blob-attributes).

## Blog platform using Walrus

As the ID of a dynamic field is derived from its type and its parent object's ID, each `Metadata` dynamic field ID is also unique. You can leverage these unique characteristics and the `Metadata` attribute pairs to build a blog platform that enables users to:

- Upload blog posts with titles.
- View their own posts and metrics.
- Delete posts they created.
- Edit post titles.
- Browse posts by other publishers.

Assume a service for the blog platform already exists to handle uploads to Walrus. When a blob and its associated NFT object is created on Walrus, this service also creates a `Metadata` dynamic field with key-value pairs for `publisher` (the Sui `Address` used to upload the blob), `view_count`, and `title`. The service restricts users from modifying the `publisher` and `view_count` pairs, but the `publisher` can update the `title` value.

When a user views a post, the service first retrieves the relevant blog post metadata from the indexed database. It then uses the `Owner` field to fetch the blob from the full node. This means the liveness of the `Blob` object on Sui is used to represent whether a blog post is available. If the `Blob` object is wrapped or deleted, the blog post is not accessible through the service, even if the underlying content on Walrus still exists.

## Data modeling

One way to model the data is with a single table that maps publisher addresses to `Metadata` dynamic fields. With this approach, the table is keyed on `dynamic_field_id` because it both identifies your dApp data and uniquely represents each uploaded blob content. The `up.sql` file to create this table looks like the following:

{@inject: examples/rust/walrus-attributes-indexer/migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_blog-post/up.sql}

### Reads

To load the blog posts from a particular publisher, you pass the `publisher` and `LIMIT` values to the following query pattern:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM blog_post
WHERE publisher = $1
ORDER BY title
LIMIT $2;
```

## Custom indexer implementation

This example uses a [sequential pipeline](../../../../concepts/custom-indexer/pipeline-architecture.mdx#sequential-pipeline-architecture), ensuring each checkpoint is committed once, in strict order, and as a single atomic operation. While this functionality is not a necessity for this project, implementing a sequential pipeline is the more straightforward option. You can always [scale up to the concurrent pipeline architecture](../../../../concepts/custom-indexer/pipeline-architecture.mdx#decision-framework) if your project needs require it.

This implementation tracks the latest object state at checkpoint boundary. When the `Metadata` dynamic field is created, mutated, wrapped or deleted, or unwrapped, it appears among the output objects in the object changes of a transaction. You can see an [example transaction](https://suivision.xyz/txblock/3Qcuo2FaTZL5wfdi7JzPELcmkuZm7hVfdNrkLrdkKioN?tab=Changes) on Testnet that creates the field. These dynamic fields have type `0x2::dynamic_field::Field<vector<u8>, 0xabc...123::metadata::Metadata>`.

| Object change to `Metadata` dynamic field | In input objects | In live output objects | How to index |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creation (or unwrap) | ❌ | ✅ | Insert row |
| Mutation | ✅ | ✅ | Update row |
| Deletion (or wrap) | ✅ | ❌ | Delete row |

### `Processor`

All pipelines implement the same [`Processor` trait](../../../../concepts/custom-indexer/pipeline-architecture.mdx#seq-processor), which defines the logic to transform a checkpoint from the ingestion task into an intermediate or final form to commit to the store. Data flows into and out of the processor, potentially out of order.

#### `process` function

The `process` function computes the `checkpoint_input_objects` and `latest_live_output_objects` sets, as you need to know only the state of objects entering and exiting the checkpoint. `Metadata` dynamic fields that exist in `checkpoint_input_objects` but not `latest_live_output_objects` are ones that were wrapped or deleted. For these deletions, you need to track only the dynamic field ID for the commit function for later deletion. Otherwise, for creation, mutation, and unwrap operations, objects exist in at least the `latest_live_output_objects` set.

{@inject: examples/rust/walrus-attributes-indexer/src/handlers/blog_post.rs#fun=process}

### `Committer`

The second and final part of the sequential pipeline is the `Committer`. Data flows from the processor into the committer out of order. The committer is responsible for batching and writing transformed data to the store in order, on checkpoint boundaries.

#### `batch`

This function defines how to batch transformed data from other processed checkpoints. This function maintains a mapping of `dynamic_field_id` to the processed Walrus `Metadata`. The batch function guarantees that the next checkpoint to batch is the next contiguous checkpoint, which means it's safe for you to overwrite the existing entry.

{@inject: examples/rust/walrus-attributes-indexer/src/handlers/blog_post.rs#fun=batch}

#### `commit`

The `commit` function conducts final transformations to the processed data before writing to the store. In this case, the logic partitions the processed data into `to_delete` and `to_upsert`.

{@inject: examples/rust/walrus-attributes-indexer/src/handlers/blog_post.rs#fun=commit}

## Putting it all together

The `main` function for the service 

{@inject: examples/rust/walrus-attributes-indexer/src/main.rs#fun=main}

To provide users with a list of posts written by a publisher, your service first queries the
database on `publisher`, yielding a result like the following. The service then uses the `blob_obj_id` to fetch the
`Blob` NFT contents. From there, you can retrieve the actual Walrus content.

```
                          dynamic_field_id                          | df_version |                             publisher                              |                            blob_obj_id                             | view_count |      title
--------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+------------------

```

## Additional considerations

All Walrus blobs have a lifetime associated with them, so you also need to track changes to expiration. Whenever the `Metadata` dynamic field changes, the parent Sui `Blob` object should also appear in output changes. You can determine the lifetime of the blob from the `Blob` object contents. However, lifetime changes to the blob typically occur on the `Blob` object itself. Because updates to the parent object don't affect the child dynamic field - unless the child dynamic field is directly modified - these lifetime changes remain invisible to the current indexing setup. There are a few ways to address this:

- Watch all `Blob` object changes.
- Watch all `BlobCertified` events.
- Construct PTBs that make calls to manage blob lifetime and ping the `Metadata` dynamic field in the same transaction.

If you don't want to perform additional work on the write side, then you are limited to the first two options. This necessitates two pipelines, one to do the work in the previous section of indexing metadata, and another to index `BlobCertified` events (or `Blob` object changes.)
