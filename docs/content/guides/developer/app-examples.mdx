## Examples

Sui is dedicated to providing a wide range of examples to guide you in proper programming techniques for the Sui blockchain. This list will continue to grow, so check back often.

- [Trading](./app-examples/trading.mdx): This example demonstrates trading objects on the Sui blockchain using a shared object as an escrow account. 
- [Blackjack](./app-examples/blackjack.mdx): This example demonstrates the logic behind an on-chain version of the popular casino card game, Blackjack.
- [Coin Flip](./app-examples/coin-flip.mdx): The Coin Flip app demonstrates on-chain randomness.
- [Distributed Counter](./app-examples/e2e-counter.mdx): An end-to-end example that creates a basic decentralized counter that anyone can increment, but only the object owner can reset it. The example includes Move code to create the package and leverages the Sui TypeScript SDK to provide a basic frontend.
- [Tic-tac-toe](./app-examples/tic-tac-toe.mdx): Three implementations of the classic tic-tac-toe game on the Sui network to demonstrate different approaches to user interaction.
- [Weather Oracle](./app-examples/weather-oracle.mdx): The Sui Weather Oracle demonstrates how to create a basic weather oracle that provides real-time weather data.
