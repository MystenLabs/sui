## Examples

Sui is dedicated to providing a wide range of examples to guide you in proper programming techniques for the Sui blockchain. This list will continue to grow, so check back often.

- [Blackjack](./app-examples/blackjack.mdx): This example demonstrates the logic behind an on-chain version of the popular casino card game, Blackjack.
- [Coin Flip](./app-examples/coin-flip.mdx): The Coin Flip app demonstrates on-chain randomness.
- [Distributed Counter](./app-examples/e2e-counter.mdx): An end-to-end example that creates a basic decentralized counter that anyone can increment, but only the object owner can reset it. The example includes Move code to create the package and leverages the Sui TypeScript SDK to provide a basic frontend.
- [Plinko](./app-examples/plinko.mdx): This example puts the classic Plinko game on chain, demonstrating use of cryptography-based strategies to create a fair and transparent game of chance. 
- [Tic-tac-toe](./app-examples/tic-tac-toe.mdx): Three implementations of the classic tic-tac-toe game on the Sui network to demonstrate different approaches to user interaction.
- [Trustless Swap](./app-examples/trustless-swap.mdx): This example demonstrates trustless swaps on the Sui blockchain using a shared object as an escrow account.
- [Weather Oracle](./app-examples/weather-oracle.mdx): The Sui Weather Oracle demonstrates how to create a basic weather oracle that provides real-time weather data.
- [Reviews Rating](./app-examples/reviews-rating.mdx): This example demonstrates implementing a reviews-rating platform for the food service industry on Sui.
