title: Distributed Counter
---

This example walks you through building a basic distributed counter app, covering the full end-to-end flow of building your Sui Move module and connecting it to your React Sui dApp. The app allows users to create counters that anyone can increment, but only the owner can reset. 

The guide is split into two parts:

1. [Smart Contracts](#smart-contracts): The Move code that sets up the `Counter` structure and logic.
1. [Frontend](#frontend): A UI that enables users to create, increment, and reset `Counter` objects.

:::

## What the guide teaches

- **Shared objects:** The guide teaches you how to use [shared objects](../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx), in this case to create globally accessible `Counter` objects.

## What you need

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](../getting-started/sui-install.mdx).

## Smart contracts {#smart-contracts}

In this part of the guide, you write the Move contracts that create, increment, and reset counters. The first step is to [set up a Move package](../first-app/write-package.mdx) for storing your Move modules.

:::info

To follow along with this guide, set your new Move package to `counter`.

:::

### `Counter` struct

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move#struct=Counter noComments}

- The `Counter` type stores the address of its `owner`, its current `value`, and its own `id`.

### Creating `Counter`

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move#fun=create noComments}

In the `create` function, a new `Counter` object is created and [shared](../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx). 

### Incrementing and resetting `Counter`

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move#fun=increment noComments}
The `increment` function accepts a mutable reference to any shared `Counter` object and will increments its `value` field.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move#fun=set_value noComments}

The `set_value` function accepts a mutable reference to any shared `Counter` object, the `value` to set its `value` field, and the `ctx` which contains the `sender` of the transaction. This function can only be ran by the `Counter`'s `owner`.

## Finished package

The final module should look like this

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move noComments}

### Deployment {#deployment}

{@include: ../../../snippets/initialize-sui-client-cli.mdx}

Next, configure the Sui CLI to use `testnet` as the active environment, as well. If you haven't already set up a `testnet` environment, do so by running the following command in a terminal or console:

```bash
sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
```

Run the following command to activate the `testnet` environment:

```bash
sui client switch --env testnet
```

{@include: ../../../snippets/publish-to-devnet-with-coins.mdx}

The output of this command contains a `packageID` value that you need to save to use the package.

```

Store the `PackageID` value you receive in your own response to [connect to your frontend](#connecting-your-package).

### Next steps

Well done. You have written and deployed the Move package! ðŸš€

To turn this into a complete dApp, you need to [create a frontend](#frontend).


## Frontend {#frontend}

In this final part of the app example, you build a frontend (UI) that allows end users to create, increment, and reset `Counter` objects.


:::info

To skip building the frontend and test out your newly deployed package, create this example using the following template and follow the instructions in the template's `README.md` file: 

```bash
pnpm create @mysten/dapp --template react-e2e-counter
```

or

```bash
yarn create @mysten/dapp --template react-e2e-counter
```

:::

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Deployed the complete `counter` Move module](#smart-contracts) and understand its design.
- Installed [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) or [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to use as the package manager.

:::tip Additional resources

- Tooling: [Sui Typescript SDK](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript) for basic usage on how to interact with Sui using Typescript.
- Tooling: [Sui dApp Kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) to learn basic building blocks for developing a dApp in the Sui ecosystem with React.js.
- Tooling: [`@mysten/dapp`](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit/create-dapp), used within this project to quickly scaffold a React-based Sui dApp.

:::

### Overview

The UI design consists of two parts:

- A button for users to create new `Counter` objects
- A `Counter` UI for users to view the `value`, and to increment and reset the `Counter` object.


### Scaffold a new app

The first step is to set up the client app. Run the following command to scaffold a new app.

```bash
pnpm create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

or

```bash
yarn create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

### Connecting your deployed package {#connecting-your-package}

Add the `packageId` value you saved from [deploying your package](#deployment) to a new `src/constants.ts` file in your project:

```ts
  export const DEVNET_COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID = "0xTODO";
  export const TESTNET_COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID = "0x7b6a8f5782e57cd948dc75ee098b73046a79282183d51eefb83d31ec95c312aa";
  export const MAINNET_COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID = "0xTODO";
```

Update the `src/networkConfig.ts` file to include the `packageID` constants.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/networkConfig.ts noComments}


### Creating `Counter`

You need a way to create a new `Counter` object. Do this by creating a new `CreateCounter` component in the new `src/CreateCounter.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { Button, Container } from '@radix-ui/themes';

export function CreateCounter( { onCreated }: { onCreated: (id: string) => void; } ) {

  function create() {
    // TODO
  }

  return (
    <Container>
      <Button
        size="3"
        onClick={() => {
          create();
        }}
      >
        Create Counter
      </Button>
    </Container>
  );
}
```

This component renders a button that enables the user to create a counter. Now, update your `create` function so that it calls the `create` function in your Move module.

To do this, you need to construct a `Transaction`, with the appropriate `moveCall` transaction, and then sign and execute the programmable transaction block (PTB).

First, import `Transaction` from `@mysten/sui`, `COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID` from your constants.ts file created previously, and `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` from `@mysten/dapp-kit`.

```tsx
import { useSignAndExecuteTransaction, useSuiClient } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

import { useNetworkVariable } from "./networkConfig";
```

Next, call the `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` hook in your component, which provides a `mutate` function you can use in your `create` function:

```tsx
export function CreateCounter( { onCreated }: { onCreated: (id: string) => void; } ) {
  const counterPackageId = useNetworkVariable("counterPackageId");
  const suiClient = useSuiClient();
  const { mutate: signAndExecute } = useSignAndExecuteTransaction({
    execute: async ({ bytes, signature }) =>
      await suiClient.executeTransactionBlock({
        transactionBlock: bytes,
        signature,
        options: {
          // Raw effects are required so the effects can be reported back to the wallet
          showRawEffects: true,
          showEffects: true,
        },
      }),
  });	

  function create() {
    // TODO
  }

  return (
    <Container>
      <Button
        size="3"
        onClick={() => {
          create();
        }}
      >
        Create Counter
      </Button>
    </Container>
  );

}
```

Finally, construct your `Transaction`:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/CreateCounter.tsx noComments}

You now have a functional component that can create a new `Counter` object, and because the `showRawEffects` and `showEffects` options are toggled on, the transaction results ensure finality. The `SuiClient` is used to set this up.

### Set up routing

Now that your users can create counters, you need a way to route to them. Routing in a React app can be complex, but this example keeps it basic. Set up your `src/App.tsx` file so that you render the `CreateCounter` component by default, and if you want to display a specific counter you can put its ID into the hash portion of the URL.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/App.tsx noComments}

This sets up your app to read the hash from the URL, and get the counter's ID if the hash is a valid object ID. Then, it either renders a `Counter` (which you define in the next step) if you have a counter ID, or the `CreateCounter` button from the previous step. When a counter is created, you update the URL, and set the counter ID.

### Building your counter user interface

Create a new file: `src/Counter.tsx`.

For your counter, you want to display three elements:

- The current count, which you fetch from the object using the `getObject` RPC method.
- An increment button, which calls the increment Move function.
- A reset button, which calls the `set_value` Move function with `0`. This is only shown if the current user owns the counter.

```tsx
import {
  useCurrentAccount,
  useSuiClientQuery,
} from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { Button, Flex, Heading, Text } from "@radix-ui/themes";


export function Counter({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount();
  const { data, isPending, error, refetch } = useSuiClientQuery("getObject", {
    id,
    options: {
      showContent: true,
      showOwner: true,
    },
  });

  const executeMoveCall = (method: "increment" | "reset") => {
    // TODO
  };

  if (isPending) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;

  if (error) return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;

  if (!data.data) return <Text>Not found</Text>;

  const ownedByCurrentAccount =
    getCounterFields(data.data)?.owner === currentAccount?.address;

  return (
    <>
      <Heading size="3">Counter {id}</Heading>

      <Flex direction="column" gap="2">
        <Text>Count: {getCounterFields(data.data)?.value}</Text>
        <Flex direction="row" gap="2">
          <Button onClick={() => executeMoveCall("increment")}>
            Increment
          </Button>
          {ownedByCurrentAccount ? (
            <Button onClick={() => executeMoveCall("reset")}>Reset</Button>
          ) : null}
        </Flex>
      </Flex>
    </>
  );
}
function getCounterFields(data: SuiObjectData) {
  if (data.content?.dataType !== "moveObject") {
    return null;
  }

  return data.content.fields as { value: number; owner: string };
}
```

This snippet has a few new concepts to examine. It uses the `useSuiClientQuery` hook to make the `getObject` RPC call. This returns a data object representing your counter. dApp Kit doesn't know which fields your counter object has, so define a `getCounterFields` helper that gets the counter fields, and adds a type-cast so that you can access the expected `value` and `owner` fields in your component.

The code also adds an `executeMoveCall` function that still needs implementing. This works just like the `create` function you used to create the counter. Instead of using a callback prop like you did for `CreateCounter`, you can use the refetch provided by `useSuiClientQuery` to reload your `Counter` object after you've executed your PTB.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/Counter.tsx noComments}

Your counter app is now ready to count. To learn more about dApp Kit, check out the [dApp Kit docs](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit).
