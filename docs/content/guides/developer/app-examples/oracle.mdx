Oracles are services that connect on-chain smart contracts with off-chain data. Blockchains are inherently isolated from outside sources for the purpose of security and reliability. Sui is no different, which means your projects cannot directly fetch real-world information, like stock prices, weather data, or sports scores. Oracles provide a bridge between the blockchain and external data sources, pulling in this information and making it available to smart contracts in a secure and verifiable way.

## Oracles available for the Sui network

The guides in this section demonstrate how to create basic oracle services for your Sui projects. As your needs become more advanced, you might consider integrating third-party services to perform the heavy lifting. There are several oracle services available for the Sui network:

| Service | Description | Contract address
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**Pyth**](https://www.pyth.network/) | Pyth is a blockchain oracle for market data. Check the [Sui guide](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/core/use-real-time-data/pull-integration/sui) on the Pyth website to learn how to integrate into your Sui projects. | [Mainnet](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0x04e20ddf36af412a4096f9014f4a565af9e812db9a05cc40254846cf6ed0ad91/tx-blocks), [Testnet](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0xf7114cc10266d90c0c9e4b84455bddf29b40bd78fe56832c7ac98682c3daa95b/tx-blocks) |
| [**Stork**](https://www.stork.network/) | Stork is an open data marketplace designed to address the limitations of traditional blockchain oracles. Check the [Stork documentation](https://docs.stork.network/) for implementation details. | [Mainnet](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0x664fcc7d42abf7583938e6e64f51aa1ede063a49f445a6a9c0206638af0a53d9/tx-blocks), [Testnet](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0x90c263290f488de268c1cdb40ff4ea24dd29dfeb0abd69606e177806075c475a/tx-blocks) |
| [**Supra**](https://supra.com/data) | Supra is a decentralized oracle network designed to connect blockchain smart contracts with real-world data, enhancing the functionality of decentralized applications across various blockchain ecosystems. Check the [Index Fund](https://docs.supra.com/oracles/indices/creating-a-new-on-chain-index).| [Mainnet](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0xc7abe17a209fcab08e2d7d939cf3df11f5b80cf03d10b50893f38df12fdebb07/tx-blocks), [Testnet](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0x3fd25bdfab06b7e29a606fa2516655b48556ae8f1efda047a70ba929b2494919/tx-blocks) |
| [**Switchboard**](https://switchboard.xyz/) | Switchboard is a permissionless oracle network that seamlessly connects apps to real-world data. Check the [On Sui](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/product-documentation/data-feeds/sui) guide for integration details. | [Mainnet](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/object/0xa81086572822d67a1559942f23481de9a60c7709c08defafbb1ca8dffc44e210/tx-blocks), [Testnet](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0x28005599a66e977bff26aeb1905a02cda5272fd45bb16a5a9eb38e8659658cff/tx-blocks) |

## Oracle guides

The following guides demonstrate how to build oracles on the Sui network. Currently, there is one guide but more are planned.

- [Sui Weather Oracle](./weather-oracle.mdx): Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather data for 1,000+ locations around the world.
