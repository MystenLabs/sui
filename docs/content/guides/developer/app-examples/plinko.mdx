---

Plinko is an example implementation of the popular casino game. The Plinko game on Sui leverages on-chain randomness to ensure fairness and transparency. Players drop Plinko balls onto a pegged board, where they randomly fall into slots representing different multipliers. This document details the game's mechanics, on-chain randomness implementation, sponsored transactions through Enoki, and TypeScript integration using codegen.

Building an on-chain Plinko game shares a lot of similarities with the [Coin Flip](./coin-flip.mdx) game and [Blackjack](./blackjack.mdx) game. For that reason, this example covers only the smart contracts (Move modules) and frontend logic.

<ImportContent source="prerequisites.mdx" mode="snippet" />

:::info

You can find the source files for this example in the [Plinko repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/tree/main) on GitHub.

A version of the game is also deployed at [Mysten Plinko](https://plinko-poc.vercel.app/).

:::

## Gameplay

The Plinko game, implemented through smart contracts on the Sui blockchain, leverages Sui's native on-chain randomness to ensure fairness and transparency. The game calculates the trace path for each ball using secure random values generated directly on-chain, determining the game's outcome based on the number of Plinko balls a player chooses to drop.

The game mechanics involve a player starting a game by specifying the number of balls and staking a certain amount. The on-chain randomness is provided through Sui's Move randomness framework, which ensures each game's randomness is cryptographically secure and cannot be predicted or manipulated. The number of Plinko balls, chosen by the player, directly influences the game's complexity and potential payout, as each ball's final position is determined by the on-chain random values that dictate the ball's path through the pegged board.

- `HouseCap`: A unique capability indicating the authority to initialize the house data.
- `HOUSE_DATA`: A one time witness for initializing house data, used once during the setup phase.

#### Initialization function

- `init`: Prepares the environment for the house, generating essential capabilities and objects for house data management.

#### Public functions

- `initialize_house_data`: Sets up the initial configuration for the house, including balance, stake limits, and multipliers.
- `top_up`: Allows adding funds to the house's balance to support game operations.
- `withdraw`: Enables the house to withdraw its balance, a critical function with implications for the house's operational capacity.
- `claim_fees`: Permits the house to collect accumulated fees from game activities.
- `update_max_stake`: Adjusts the maximum stake limit for games.
- `update_min_stake`: Modifies the minimum stake requirement.
- `update_multiplier_vector`: Updates the multiplier vector used to calculate game outcomes.

#### Internal helper functions

- `set_multiplier_vector`: Internally used to set the initial multiplier vector.

#### Accessors

Provide read-only and mutable access to house data properties, enabling operations like querying balance, stake limits, fees, and modifying configurations within authorized contexts:

- `balance`: Returns the house's current balance.
- `house`: Retrieves the house's address.
- `max_stake`, `min_stake`: Access the current stake limits.

## Enoki sponsorship

The Plinko game demonstrates a frictionless user experience by leveraging [Enoki](https://docs.enoki.mystenlabs.com/) for transaction sponsorship. This allows players to interact with the game without needing to hold SUI tokens for gas fees, significantly reducing barriers to entry.

### How sponsorship works

The sponsorship flow is split into two backend API endpoints that work with the Enoki client:

1. **`/sponsor` endpoint**: Receives unsigned transaction bytes from the frontend and calls `enokiClient.createSponsoredTransaction()` to sponsor them. Returns the sponsored (but still unsigned) transaction bytes and digest.

2. **`/execute` endpoint**: Receives the transaction digest and user signature, then calls `enokiClient.executeSponsoredTransaction()` to submit the sponsored and signed transaction to the blockchain.

The complete flow works as follows:

1. **Frontend constructs transaction**: The UI builds a programmable transaction block (PTB) with the necessary Move calls (such as, `plinko::start_game`) and serializes it to `TransactionKind` bytes.

2. **Request sponsorship**: The unsigned transaction bytes are sent to `/sponsor`, which returns sponsored unsigned bytes.

3. **User signs**: The player signs the sponsored transaction bytes through their wallet.

4. **Execute transaction**: The signed transaction is sent to `/execute`, which submits it to the blockchain.

This two-step process ensures that:
- Players only need to sign transactions (proving ownership)
- The game operator covers all gas fees through Enoki
- The user experience is seamless and Web2-like
- **Important:** Set `useGasCoin: false` when creating coins for sponsored transactions

### Implementation Example

#### Backend: `/sponsor` endpoint

```typescript
import { enokiClient } from "../EnokiClient";

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  try {
    const { transactionKindBytes, sender } = await req.json();

      transactionKindBytes,
      sender,
      allowedAddresses: [sender],
    });

    return NextResponse.json(
      { bytes: sponsored.bytes, digest: sponsored.digest },
      { status: 200 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Sponsorship failed:", error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Sponsorship failed" }, { status: 500 });
  }
};
```

#### Backend: `/execute` endpoint

```typescript
import { enokiClient } from "../EnokiClient";

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  try {
    const { digest, signature } = await req.json();
    const executionResult = await enokiClient.executeSponsoredTransaction({
      digest,
      signature,
    });
    return NextResponse.json(
      { digest: executionResult.digest },
      { status: 200 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Execution failed:", error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Execution failed" }, { status: 500 });
  }
};
```

#### Frontend: Complete sponsorship flow

```typescript
// 1) Create the tx and get TransactionKind bytes
const tx = new Transaction();
tx.setSender(sender);
const betCoin = coinWithBalance({
  type: "0x2::sui::SUI",
  balance: betInMist,
  useGasCoin: false, // important for sponsorship
})(tx);
tx.add(
  plinko.startGame({
    package: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PACKAGE_ADDRESS,
    arguments: [betCoin, `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HOUSE_DATA_ID}`],
  })
);

const txBytes = await tx.build({
  client,
  onlyTransactionKind: true,
});

// 2) Sponsor the unsigned TxBytes
const sponsorResp = await fetch("/api/sponsor", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    transactionKindBytes: toBase64(txBytes),
    sender,
  }),
});

if (!sponsorResp.ok) {
  console.error("Failed to sponsor transaction:", sponsorResp.status);
  showError("Failed to sponsor transaction. Please try again.");
  return;
}

const { bytes: sponsoredBytes, digest: sponsoredDigest } =
  (await sponsorResp.json()) as { bytes: string; digest: string };

// 3) Sign the sponsored TxBytes
const { signature } = await signTransaction({
  transaction: sponsoredBytes,
});

// 4) Execute the sponsored + signed TxBytes
const execResp = await fetch("/api/execute", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ digest: sponsoredDigest, signature }),
});
```

## TypeScript Integration with Codegen

The Plinko frontend uses [Mysten's codegen tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/codegen?activeTab=readme) to automatically generate TypeScript bindings from the Move smart contracts. This provides several advantages:

### Usage example

Instead of manually building transaction blocks, you can use generated functions:

```typescript
import { plinko } from './generated/plinko';

// Type-safe function call with autocomplete
const tx = plinko.startGame({
  coin: coinObject,
  houseData: houseDataId,
});
```

## Deployment

Navigate to the [setup folder](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/tree/main/setup) of the Plinko repository and execute the `publish.sh` script. Refer to the [README instructions](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/blob/main/README.md) for deploying the smart contracts and testing them locally.


## Frontend

The Plinko frontend is built with React and integrates with the Sui blockchain using sponsored transactions through Enoki. The application provides an interactive and responsive gaming experience while abstracting away blockchain complexity from end users.

### State management and setup

- **State hooks**: The application uses React's `useState` to manage game states, including `finalPaths`, `isPlaying`, `totalWon`, and more. These states track the current game status and update the UI in real-time.

- **Sponsored transactions**: The frontend leverages Enoki's `/sponsor` and `/execute` APIs to create a gasless experience. Players can interact with the game without needing SUI tokens, as the backend sponsors all transaction fees.

- **TypeScript integration**: Generated TypeScript bindings from codegen provide type-safe contract interactions, reducing errors and improving developer experience.

## UI components and styling

The `MatterSim` and `PlinkoSettings` components are the foundation for the Plinko frontend. To see code for all components and source files, see the [Plinko repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/tree/main/app/src).  

### Simulation component

The [`MatterSim` component](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/blob/main/app/src/components/MatterSim.tsx) renders the game board with realistic physics for the dropping Plinko balls. It uses [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/), a 2D physics engine, to simulate the game dynamics.

```ts
import Matter, {
  Engine,
  Render,
  Runner,
  Bodies,
  Composite,
  Vector,
  Events,
  Body,
  Common,
} from "matter-js";
```

The component receives ball paths (trace data) generated from on-chain randomness, emitted in the `GameFinished` event. Each path consists of 12 bytes per ball, where each byte determines whether the ball moves left (odd) or right (even) at each peg. `MatterSim` applies physics principles like gravity for natural ball descent while using custom forces to guide balls along their predetermined paths. The physics simulation provides smooth, realistic movement that matches the on-chain outcomes, creating an engaging visual experience where fairness is guaranteed by blockchain randomness.

## Plinko settings component

The [`PlinkoSettings` component](https://github.com/MystenLabs/plinko-poc/blob/main/app/src/components/PlinkoSettings.tsx) is an integral part of the user interface in the Plinko game, enabling players to customize their gameplay experience according to their preferences. This React component allows users to select the number of Plinko balls they want to drop, set the bet size for each ball, and initiate the game round by pressing the **Play** button.

### Customization options

- `betSize` (per ball): Players can specify the amount they want to bet on each ball. This is a crucial feature that allows users to manage their risk and potential rewards.
- `numberOfBalls`: This setting lets players choose how many balls they want to play in a single round, adding a strategic layer to the game as the total bet size is a multiplication of the bet size per ball and the number of balls.

## User interaction and feedback

Game Initiation: After selecting the desired number of balls and setting the bet size for each, players can initiate a new game by pressing the **Play** button. This action starts the game, with the button becoming disabled during gameplay to prevent new games from being initiated until the current game concludes and the last ball has reached the end. Links are also provided for players to view game details on a Sui network explorer for transparency and engagement.
