Escrow refers to a legal concept where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account that is released only when all of the terms of an agreement are met as overseen by the party acting as the escrow authority.

This guide and example demonstrate an atomic swap on Sui, which is similar to an escrow but does not require a trusted third party. Instead, this example uses a [shared object](../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx) to act as the escrow between two Sui users wanting to trade. Shared objects are a unique concept to Sui. Any transaction and any signer can modify it, given the changes meet the requirements set forth by the package that defined the type.

See [Shared versus Owned Objects](../sui-101/shared-owned.mdx) for more information on the differences between object types.

The guide is split into three parts:

1. [Backend](./trading/backend.mdx): The modules that hold the state and perform the swaps.
1. [Indexing and API Service](./trading/indexer-api.mdx): A service that indexes chain state to discover trades, and an API service to read this data.
1. [Frontend](./trading/frontend.mdx): Enables users to list objects for sale and to accept trades.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](../getting-started/sui-install.mdx).
- [Configured a valid network environment](../../../references/cli/client.mdx#set-current-environment), as you will be deploying the module on Testnet.
