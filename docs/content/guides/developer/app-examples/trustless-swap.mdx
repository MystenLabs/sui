title: Trustless Swap
description: An app that performs atomic swaps on Sui. Atomic swaps are similar to escrows but without requiring a trusted third party.
effort: large
---

{@include: ../../../snippets/app-examples-swap-source.mdx}

This guide demonstrates how to make an app that performs atomic swaps on Sui. Atomic swaps are similar to escrows but without requiring a trusted third party.

There are three main sections to this guide:

1. [Smart Contracts](#smart-contracts): The Move code that holds the state and perform the swaps.
1. [Backend](#backend): A service that indexes chain state to discover trades, and an API service to read this data.
1. [Frontend](#frontend): A UI that enables users to list objects for sale and to accept trades.

## What the guide teaches

- **Shared objects:** The guide teaches you how to use [shared objects](../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx), in this case to act as the escrow between two Sui users wanting to trade. Shared objects are a unique concept to Sui. Any transaction and any signer can modify it, given the changes meet the requirements set forth by the package that defined the type.
- **Composability:** The guide teaches you how to design your Move code in a way that enables full composability. In this app, the Move code that handles trading is completely unaware of the code that defines the objects it is trading and vice versa.

The guide also shows how to build an app that:

- **Is trustless:** Users do not have to trust (or pay) any third parties; the chain manages the swap.
- **Avoids rug-pulls:** Guarantees that the object a user wants to trade for isn't tampered with after initiating the trade.
- **Preserves liveness:** Users are able to pull out of the trade and reclaim their object at any time, in case the other party stops responding.

## What you need

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](../getting-started/sui-install.mdx).
- [Configured a valid network environment](../../../references/cli/client.mdx#set-current-environment), as the guide has you deploy the module on Testnet.
- [Acquired Devnet or Testnet](../getting-started/get-coins.mdx) tokens for development purposes.
- Read the basics of [shared versus owned objects](../sui-101/shared-owned.mdx).

## Directory structure

To begin, create a new folder on your system titled `trading` that holds all your files. Inside that folder, create three more folders: `api`, `contracts`, and `frontend`. It's important to keep this directory structure as some helper scripts in this example target these directories by name. Different projects have their own directory structure, but it's common to split code into functional groups to help with maintenance.

:::checkpoint

- You have the latest version of Sui installed. If you run `sui --version` in your terminal or console, it responds with the currently installed version.
- Your active environment is pointing to the expected network. Run `sui client active-env` to make sure. If you receive a warning about a client and server API version mismatch, update Sui using the version in the relevant branch (`mainnet`, `testnet`, `devent`) of the Sui repo.
- Your active address has SUI. Run `sui client balance` in your terminal or console. If there is no balance, [acquire SUI](../getting-started/get-coins.mdx) from the faucet (not available in Mainnet).
- You have a directory to place the files you create in. The suggested names of the directories are important if you use the available helper functions later in the guide.

:::

## Smart contracts {#smart-contracts}

In this part of the guide, you write the Move contracts that perform the trustless swaps. The first step is to [set up a Move package](../first-app/write-package.mdx) for storing your Move modules. The guide describes how to create the package from scratch, but you can use a fork or copy of the example code in the Sui repo to follow along instead.

### Move.toml

To begin writing your smart contracts, create an `escrow` folder in your `contracts` folder (if using recommended directory names). Create a file inside the folder named `Move.toml` and copy the following code into it. This is the package manifest file. If you want to learn more about the structure of the file, see [Package Manifest](https://move-book.com/concepts/manifest.html) in The Move Book.

:::info

If you are targeting a network other than Testnet, be sure to update the `rev` value for the Sui dependency.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/Move.toml}

### Locked and Key

With your manifest file in place, it's time to start creating the Move assets for this project. In your `escrow` folder, at the same level as your `Move.toml` file, create a `sources` folder. This is the common file structure of a package in Move. Create a new file inside `sources` titled `lock.move`. This file contains the logic that locks the object involved in a trade. The complete source code for this file follows and the sections that come after detail its components.

</details>

After a trade is initiated, you don't want the trading party to modify the object they agreed to trade. Imagine you're trading in-game items and you agree to trade a weapon with all its attachments, and its owner strips all its attachments just before the trade.

In a traditional trade, a third party typically holds the items in escrow to make sure they are not tampered with before the trade completes. This requires either trusting that the third party won't tamper with it themselves, paying the third party to ensure that doesn't happen, or both.

In a trustless swap, however, you can use the safety properties of Move to force an item's owner to prove that they have not tampered with the version of the object that you agreed to trade, without involving anyone else.

This is done by requiring that an object that is available for trading is **locked** with a **single-use key**, and asking the owner to supply the key when finalizing the trade.

To tamper with the object would require unlocking it, which consumes the key. Consequently, there would no longer be a key to finish the trade.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#struct=Locked,Key noComments}

- The `Locked<T>` type stores the `ID` of the key that unlocks it, and its own `id`. The object being locked is added as a dynamic object field, so that it is still readable at its own ID off chain.
- The corresponding `Key` type only stores its own `id`.

The lock and key are made single-use by the signatures of the `lock` and `unlock` functions. `lock` accepts any object of type `T: store` (the `store` ability is necessary for storing it inside a `Locked<T>`), and creates both the `Locked<T>` and its corresponding `Key`:

<details>
<summary>
`lock` function in `lock.move`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#fun=lock noComments}
</details>


The `unlock` function accepts the `Locked<T>` and `Key` by value (which consumes them), and returns the underlying `T` as long as the correct key has been supplied for the lock:

<details>
<summary>

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#variable=ELockKeyMismatch noComments}
{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#fun=unlock noTitle noComments}
</details>


Together, they ensure that a lock and key cannot have existed before the lock operation, and will not exist after a successful unlock – it is single use.

:::

### Testing Locked and Key

Move's type system guarantees that a given `Key` cannot be re-used (because `unlock` accepts it by value), but there are some properties that need to be confirmed with tests:

- A locked object can be unlocked with its key.
- Trying to unlock an object with the wrong key fails.

The test starts with a helper function for creating an object, it doesn't matter what kind of object it is, as long as it has the `store` ability. The test uses `Coin<SUI>`, because it comes with a `#[test_only]` function for minting:

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#fun=test_coin noComments}

- All test-related functions and imports are annotated with `#[test_only]` to make sure they don't show up in the published package. This can also be done by separating tests into their own module – e.g. `lock_tests.move` – and marking that module as `#[test_only]`.
- The `test_scenario` module is used to provide access to a `&mut TxContext` in the test (necessary for creating new objects). Tests that don't need to simulate multiple transactions but still need access to a `TxContext` can use `sui::tx_context::dummy` to create a test context instead.

The first test works by creating an object to test, locking it and unlocking it – this should finish executing without aborting.
The last two lines exist to keep the Move compiler happy by cleaning up the test coin and test scenario objects, because values in Move are not implicitly cleaned up unless they have the `drop` ability.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#fun=test_lock_unlock noComments}

The other test is testing a failure scenario – that an abort happens. It creates two locked objects (this time the values are just `u64`s), and use the key from one to try and unlock the other, which should fail (specified using the `expected_failure` attribute).

Unlike the previous test, the same clean up is not needed, because the code is expected to terminate. Instead, add another abort after the code that you expect to abort (making sure to use a different code for this second abort).

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/lock.move#fun=test_lock_key_mismatch noComments}

:::

:::checkpoint

At this point, you have 
- A Move package consisting of a manifest file (`Move.toml`)
- A `lock.move` file in your `sources` folder. 

From your `escrow` folder, run `sui move test` in your terminal or console. If successful, you get a response similar to the following that confirms the package builds and your tests pass:

```
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib

[ PASS    ] escrow::lock::test_lock_key_mismatch
[ PASS    ] escrow::lock::test_lock_unlock
Test result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0
```

You might notice that the Move compiler creates a `build` subfolder inside `escrow` upon a successful build. This folder contains your package's compiled bytecode, code from your package's dependencies, and various other files necessary for the build. At this point, it's enough to just be aware of these files. You don't need to fully understand the contents in `build`.

:::

### The Escrow protocol {#escrow}

Create a new file in your `escrow` folder titled `shared.move`. The code in this file creates the shared `Escrow` object and completes the trading logic. The complete source code for this file follows and the sections that come after detail its components.

<details>
<summary>
`shared.move`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move noComments}
</details>

Trading proceeds in three steps:

1. The first party locks the object they want to trade – this is already handled by the `lock` module you wrote earlier.
1. The second party puts their object up for escrow and registers their interest in the first party's object. This is handled by a new module – `escrow`.
1. The first party completes the trade by providing their locked object and the key to unlock it. Assuming all checks pass, this transfers their object to the second party and makes the second party's object available to them.

You can start by implementing steps two and three, by defining a new type to hold the escrowed object. It holds the `escrowed` object and an `id: UID` (because it's an object in its own right), but it also records the `sender` and intended `recipient` (to confirm they match when the trade happens), and it registers interest in the first party's object by recording the `ID` of the key that unlocks the `Locked<U>` that contains the object.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#struct=Escrow noComments singleSpace}

You also need to create a function for creating the `Escrow` object. The object is shared because it needs to be accessed by the address that created it (in case the object needs to be returned) and by the intended recipient (to complete the swap).

<details>
<summary>
`create` function in `shared.move`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#noemit noComments}
</details>

If the second party stops responding, the first party can unlock their object. You need to create a function so the second party can recover their object in the symmetric case as well.

- It needs to check that the caller matches `sender`, because `Escrow` objects are shared and anybody can access them.
- It accepts the `Escrow` by value so that it can clean it up after extracting the escrowed object, reclaiming the storage rebate for the sender and cleaning up an unused object on chain.

<details>
<summary>
`return_to_sender` function in `shared.move`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#fun=return_to_sender noComments}
</details>

Finally, you need to add a function to allow the first party to complete the trade.

- This function also accepts the `Escrow` by value because it consumes it after the swap is complete.
- It checks that the sender of the transaction is the intended recipient (the first party), and that the ID of the key that they provided matches the key specified when the object was escrowed. This ensures no tampering occurs, because this key can be provided only if it had not been used to unlock the object, which proves the object has not left its `Locked<U>` between the call to `create` and to `swap`. You can inspect the `lock` module to see that it cannot be modified while in there.
- The call to `unlock` further checks that the key matches the locked object that was provided.
- Instead of transferring the escrowed object to the recipient address, it is returned by the `swap` function. You can do this because you checked that the transaction sender is the recipient, and it makes this API more composable. Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) provide the flexibility to decide whether to transfer the object as it is received or do something else with it.

### Testing

Tests for the `escrow` module are more involved than for `lock` – as they take advantage of `test_scenario`'s ability to simulate multiple transactions from different senders, and interact with shared objects.

The guide focuses on the test for a successful swap, but you can find a link to all the tests later on.

As with the lock test, start by creating a function to mint a test coin. You also create some constants to represent our transaction senders, `ALICE`, `BOB`, and `DIANE`.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#fun=test_coin noComments}

The test body starts with a call to `test_scenario::begin` and ends with a call to `test_scenario::end`. It doesn't matter which address you pass to `begin`, because you pick one of `ALICE` or `BOB` at the start of each new transaction you write, so set it to `@0x0`:

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#test}

The first transaction is from `BOB` who creates a coin and locks it. You must remember the ID of the coin and the ID of the key, which you will need later, and then you transfer the locked object and the key itself to `BOB`, because this is what would happen in a real transaction: When simulating transactions in a test, you should only keep around primitive values, not whole objects, which would need to be written to chain between transactions.

Write these transactions inside the `test_successful_swap` function, between the call to `begin` and `end`.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#variable=i2 noComments}

Next, `ALICE` comes along and sets up the `Escrow`, which locks their coin. They register their interest for `BOB'`s coin by referencing `BOB`'s key's ID (`ik2`):

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#variable=i1 noComments}

Finally, `BOB` completes the trade by calling `swap`. The `take_shared` function is used to simulate accepting a shared input. It uses type inference to know that the object must be an `Escrow`, and finds the last object of this type that was shared (by `ALICE` in the previous transaction). Similarly, use `take_from_sender` to simulate accepting owned inputs (in this case, `BOB`'s lock and key). The coin returned by `swap` is transferred back to `BOB`, as if it was called as part of a PTB, followed by a transfer command.

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#bob noComments}

The rest of the test is designed to check that `ALICE` has `BOB`'s coin and vice versa. It starts by calling `next_tx` to make sure the effects of the previous transaction have been committed, before running the necessary checks.

:::

### Observability

The `escrow` Move package is now functional: You could publish it on chain and perform trustless swaps by creating transactions. Creating those transactions requires knowing the IDs of `Locked`, `Key`, and `Escrow` objects.

`Locked` and `Key` objects are typically owned by the transaction sender, and so can be queried through the Sui RPC, but `Escrow` objects are shared, and it is useful to be able to query them by their sender and recipient (so that users can see the trades they have offered and received).

Querying `Escrow` objects by their sender or recipient requires custom indexing, and to make it easy for the indexer to spot relevant transactions, add the following **events** to `escrow.move`:

{@inject: examples/trading/contracts/escrow/sources/shared.move#struct=EscrowCreated,EscrowSwapped,EscrowCancelled noComments}

Functions responsible for various aspects of the escrow's lifecycle emit these events. The custom indexer can then subscribe to transactions that emit these events and process only those, rather than the entire chain state:

</details>

:::checkpoint

You now have `shared.move` and `locked.move` files in your `sources` folder. From the parent `escrow` folder, run `sui move test` in your terminal or console. If successful, you get a response similar to the following that confirms the package builds and your tests pass: 

```

Test result: OK. Total tests: 8; passed: 8; failed: 0
```

:::

### Next steps

Well done. You have written the Move package! 🚀

To turn this into a complete dApp, you need to create a frontend. However, for the frontend to be updated, it has to listen to the blockchain as escrows are made and swaps are fulfilled.

To achieve this, in the next step you create an indexing service.

## Backend indexer {#backend}

With the contract adapted to emit events, you can now write an indexer that keeps track of all active `Escrow` objects and exposes an API for querying objects by sender or recipient. 

The indexer is backed by a Prisma DB with the following schema:

<details>
<summary>
`schema.prisma`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/api/prisma/schema.prisma}
</details>

The core of the indexer is an event loop, initialized in a function called `setupListeners`.

{@inject: examples/trading/api/indexer.ts}

The indexer queries events related to the `escrow` module, using a `queryEvent` filter, and keeps track of a cursor representing the latest event it has processed so it can resume indexing from the right place even if it is restarted. The filter is looking for any events whose type is from the `escrow` module of the Move package (see the `event-indexer.ts` code that follows).

The core event job works by polling: It queries RPC for events following its latest cursor and sends them to a callback for processing. If it detects more than one page of new events, it immediately requests the next page. Otherwise, the job waits for the next polling interval before checking again.

<details>
<summary>
`event-indexer.ts`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/api/indexer/event-indexer.ts}
</details>

The callback is responsible for reading the event and updating the database accordingly. For demo purposes, SQLite is being used, and so you need to issue a separate `UPSERT` to the database for each escrowed object. In a production setting, however, you would want to batch requests to the database to optimize data flow.

`escrow-handler.ts`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/api/indexer/escrow-handler.ts}

- Reference: [JSON-RPC](https://docs.sui.io/sui-api-ref)

:::


### API service

The data that the indexer captures can then be served over an API, so that a frontend can read it. Follow the next section to implement the API in TypeScript, to run on Node, using Express.

#### Query parameters

You want your API to accept the query string in the URL as the parameters for database `WHERE` query. Hence, you want a utility that can extract and parse the URL query string into valid query parameters for Prisma. With the `parseWhereStatement()` function, the callers filter the set of keys from the URL query string and transforms those corresponding key-value pairs into the correct format for Prisma.

<details>
<summary>
`parseWhereStatement` in `api-queries.ts`
</summary>

{@inject: examples/trading/api/utils/api-queries.ts#type=WhereParam noTitle}
{@inject: examples/trading/api/utils/api-queries.ts#variable=parseWhereStatement noTitle}
</details>


#### Query pagination

Pagination is another crucial part to ensure your API returns sufficient and/or ordered chunk of information instead of all the data that might be the vector for a DDOS attack. Similar to **WHERE parameters**, define a set of keys in the URL query string to be accepted as valid pagination parameters. The `parsePaginationForQuery()` utility function helps to achieve this by filtering the pre-determined keys `sort`, `limit`, `cursor` and parsing corresponding key-value pairs into `ApiPagination` that Prisma can consume.

In this example, the `id` field of the model in the database as the cursor that allows clients to continue subsequent queries with the next page.

<details>
<summary>
`parsePaginationForQuery` in `api-queries.ts`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/api/utils/api-queries.ts#type=ApiPagination}
{@inject: examples/trading/api/utils/api-queries.ts#variable=parsePaginationForQuery noTitle}
</details>

#### API endpoints

All the endpoints are defined in `server.ts`, particularly, there are two endpoints:

- `/locked` to query `Locked` objects.
- `/escrows` to query `Escrow` objects.

You define a list of valid query keys, such as `deleted`, `creator`, `keyId`, and `objectId` for `Locked` data and `cancelled`, `swapped`, `recipient`, and `sender` for `Escrow` data. Pass the URL query string into the pre-defined utilities to output the correct parameters that Prisma can use.

<details>
<summary>
`server.ts`
</summary>
{@inject: examples/trading/api/server.ts}
</details>

### Deployment {#deployment}

Now that you have an indexer and an API service, you can deploy your move package and start the indexer and API service.

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install --ignore-workspace` or `yarn install --ignore-workspace`.

2. Setup the database by running `pnpm db:setup:dev` or `yarn db:setup:dev`.

3. Deploy the Sui package

  <details>
    <summary>
      Deployment instructions
    </summary>
    {@include: ../../../snippets/initialize-sui-client-cli.mdx}

  Next, configure the Sui CLI to use `testnet` as the active environment. 

  Use the following command to list your available environments:

  ```bash
  sui client envs
  ```

  If you haven't already set up a `testnet` environment, do so by running the following command in a terminal or console:

  ```bash
  sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
  ```

  Run the following command to activate the `testnet` environment:

  ```bash
  sui client switch --env testnet
  ```

  Before being able to publish your package to Testnet, you need Testnet SUI tokens. To get some, run the following command: 

  ```bash
  sui client faucet
  ```

  For other ways to get SUI in your Testnet account, see [Get SUI Tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins).

  Now that you have an account with some Testnet SUI, you can deploy your contracts. 

  There are some helper functions to publish the smart contracts so you can create some demo data (for Testnet). The helper function to publish the smart contrqcts expects built smart contracts in both the `escrow` and `demo` directories. Run `sui move build` in both directories, if necessary. Be sure to update the Sui dependency in the manifest to point to the correct source based on your environment. 

  To publish the smart contracts and produce demo data: 

  1. Publish the smart contracts by running the following command from your `api` folder: 

      ```
      npx ts-node helpers/publish-contracts.ts
      ```

      If successful, `demo-contract.json` and `escrow-contract.json` are created in the backend root directory. These files contain the contract addresses and are used by the backend and frontend to interact with the contracts.

  2. Produce demo non-locked and locked objects

      ```
      npx ts-node helpers/create-demo-data.ts
      ```

  3. Produce demo escrows

      ```
      npx ts-node helpers/create-demo-escrows.ts
      ```

  If you want to reset the database (for a clean demo, for example), run `pnpm db:reset:dev && pnpm db:setup:dev` or `yarn db:reset:dev && yarn db:setup:dev`.
</details>

4. Run both the API and the indexer by running `pnpm dev` or `yarn dev`.

5. Visit [http://localhost:3000/escrows](http://localhost:3000/escrows) or [http://localhost:3000/locked](http://localhost:3000/locked)

:::checkpoint

You should now have an indexer running. 
- If you visit `localhost:3000`, you get a message that the service is running: `{"message":"🚀 API is functional 🚀"}`.
- If you visit `localhost:3000/escrows`, you see the demo escrow data the helper scripts created for you. Likewise, visiting `http://localhost:3000/locked` displays the raw JSON the script created for demo objects.

:::


### Next steps

With the code successfully deployed on Testnet, you can now [create a frontend](#frontend) to display the trading data and to allow users to interact with the Move modules.

## Frontend {#frontend}

In this final part of the app example, you build a frontend (UI) that allows end users to discover trades and interact with listed escrows.

### Prerequisites

{@include: ../../../snippets/app-examples-swap-source.mdx}

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Completed the smart contracts](#smart-contracts) and understand their design.
- [Implemented the backend](#backend) to learn how to index on-chain data and expose it through an API.
- [Deployed your smart contracts and started the backend indexer](#deployment).
- Installed [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) or [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to use as the package manager.

### Overview

The UI design consists of three parts:

- A header containing the button allowing users to connect their wallet and navigate to other pages.
- A place for users to manage their owned objects to be ready for escrow trading called `Manage Objects`.
- A place for users to discover, create, and execute trades called `Escrows`.

### Scaffold a new app

The first step is to set up the client app. Run the following command to scaffold a new app from your `frontend` folder.

<Tabs groupId="packagemanager">
  <TabItem label="PNPM" value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn" value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When asked for a name for your dApp, provide one of your liking. The dApp scaffold gets created in a new directory with the name you provide. This is convenient to keep your working code separate from the example source code that might already populate this folder. The codeblocks that follow point to the code in the default example location. Be aware the path to your own code includes the dApp name you provide.

### Setting up import aliases

First, set up import aliases to make the code more readable and maintainable. This allows you to import files using `@/` instead of relative paths.

<details>
  <summary>
    Replace the content of `tsconfig.json` with the following:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/tsconfig.json}
</details>

The paths option under `compilerOptions` is what defines the aliasing for TypeScript. Here, the alias `@/*` is mapped to the `./src/*` directory, meaning that any time you use `@/`, TypeScript resolves it as a reference to the `src` folder. This setup reduces the need for lengthy relative paths when importing files in your project.

<details>
  <summary>
    Replace the content of `vite.config.ts` with the following:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/vite.config.ts}
</details>

Vite also needs to be aware of the aliasing to resolve imports correctly during the build process. In the `resolve.alias` configuration of `vite.config.ts`, we map the alias `@` to the `/src` directory.

### Adding Tailwind CSS

To streamline the styling process and keep the codebase clean and maintainable, this guide uses Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first CSS classes to rapidly build custom designs. Run the following command from the base of your dApp project to add Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="packagemanager">
  <TabItem label="PNPM" value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn" value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, generate the Tailwind CSS configuration file by running the following:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

<details>
  <summary>
    Replace the content of `tailwind.config.js` with the following:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/tailwind.config.js}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Add the `src/styles/` directory and add `base.css`: 
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/styles/base.css}
</details>

### Connecting your deployed package

First, deploy your package via the [scripts in the api directory](#deployment).

<details>
  <summary>
    Then, create a `src/constants.ts` file and fill it with the following:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/constants.ts}
</details>

:::warning

If you create a dApp using a project name so that your `src` files are in a subfolder of `frontend`, be sure to add another nesting level (`../`) to the import statements.

:::

### Add helper functions and UI components

<details>
  <summary>
    Create a `src/utils/` directory and add the following file: 
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/utils/helpers.ts}
</details>

Create a `src/components/` directory and add the following components: 

<details>
  <summary>
    `ExplorerLink.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/ExplorerLink.tsx}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    `InfiniteScrollArea.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/InfiniteScrollArea.tsx}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    `Loading.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/Loading.tsx}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    `SuiObjectDisplay.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/SuiObjectDisplay.tsx}
</details>

Install the necessary dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="packagemanager">
  <TabItem label="PNPM" value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add react-hot-toast
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn" value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add react-hot-toast
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Set up routing {#routing}

The imported template only has a single page. To add more pages, you need to set up routing.

First, install the necessary dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="packagemanager">
  <TabItem label="PNPM" value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add react-router-dom
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn" value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add react-router-dom
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>
    Then, create a `src/routes/` directory and add `index.tsx`. This file contains the routing configuration:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/routes/index.tsx}
</details>

Add the following respective files to the `src/routes/` directory:

<details>
  <summary>
    `root.tsx`. This file contains the root component that is rendered on every page:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/routes/root.tsx}
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    `LockedDashboard.tsx`. This file contains the component for the `Manage Objects` page.
  </summary>
```tsx
export function LockedDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Locked Dashboard</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    `EscrowDashboard.tsx`. This file contains the component for the `Escrows` page.
  </summary>
```tsx
export function EscrowDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Escrow Dashboard</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  Update `src/main.tsx` by replacing the `App` component with the `RouterProvider` and replace `"dark"` with `"light"` in the `Theme` component:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/main.tsx}
</details>

Note that `dApp Kit` provides a set of hooks for making query and mutation calls to the Sui blockchain. These hooks are thin wrappers around query and mutation hooks from `@tanstack/react-query`.

<details>
  <summary>
    Create `src/components/Header.tsx`. This file contains the navigation links and the connect wallet button:
  </summary>
```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { SizeIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import { Box, Container, Flex, Heading } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";

const menu = [
  {
    title: "Escrows",
    link: "/escrows",
  },
  {
    title: "Manage Objects",
    link: "/locked",
  },
];

export function Header() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Flex
        position="sticky"
        px="4"
        py="2"
        justify="between"
        className="border-b flex flex-wrap"
      >
        <Box>
          <Heading className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <SizeIcon width={24} height={24} />
            Trading Demo
          </Heading>
        </Box>

        <Box className="flex gap-5 items-center">
          {menu.map((item) => (
            <NavLink
              key={item.link}
              to={item.link}
              className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
                `cursor-pointer flex items-center gap-2 ${
                  isPending
                    ? "pending"
                    : isActive
                      ? "font-bold text-blue-600"
                      : ""
                }`
              }
            >
              {item.title}
            </NavLink>
          ))}
        </Box>

        <Box className="connect-wallet-wrapper">
          <ConnectButton />
        </Box>
      </Flex>
    </Container>
  );
}
```
</details>

The dApp Kit comes with a pre-built React.js component called `ConnectButton` displaying a button to connect and disconnect a wallet. The connecting and disconnecting wallet logic is handled seamlessly so you don't need to worry about repeating yourself doing the same logic all over again.

:::checkpoint

At this point, you have a basic routing setup. Run your app and ensure you can:

- Navigate between the `Manage Objects` and `Escrows` pages.
- Connect and disconnect your wallet.

Note, the styles should be applied. The `Header` component should look like this: 

![Header component](./images/styles.png)

:::

### Type definitions

<details>
  <summary>
    All the type definitions are in `src/types/types.ts`. Create this file and add the following:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/types/types.ts}
</details>

`ApiLockedObject` and `ApiEscrowObject` represent the `Locked` and `Escrow` indexed data model the indexing and API service return.

`EscrowListingQuery` and `LockedListingQuery` are the query parameters model to provide to the API service to fetch from the endpoints `/escrow` and `/locked` accordingly.

### Display owned objects

Now, display the objects owned by the connected wallet address. This is the `Manage Objects` page.

<details>
  <summary>
    First add this file `src/components/locked/LockOwnedObjects.tsx`: 
  </summary>
```tsx
import { useCurrentAccount, useSuiClientInfiniteQuery } from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { SuiObjectDisplay } from "@/components/SuiObjectDisplay";
import { InfiniteScrollArea } from "@/components/InfiniteScrollArea";

/**
 * A component that fetches all the objects owned by the connected wallet address
 * and allows the user to lock them, so they can be used in escrow.
 */
export function LockOwnedObjects() {
  const account = useCurrentAccount();

  const { data, fetchNextPage, isFetchingNextPage, hasNextPage, refetch } =
    useSuiClientInfiniteQuery(
      "getOwnedObjects",
      {
        owner: account?.address!,
        options: {
          showDisplay: true,
          showType: true,
        },
      },
      {
        enabled: !!account,
        select: (data) =>
          data.pages
            .flatMap((page) => page.data)
            .filter(
              // we're filtering out objects that don't have Display or image_url
              // for demo purposes. The Escrow contract works with all objects.
              (x) => !!x.data?.display && !!x.data?.display?.data?.image_url,
            ),
      },
    );

  return (
    <InfiniteScrollArea
      loadMore={() => fetchNextPage()}
      hasNextPage={hasNextPage}
      loading={isFetchingNextPage}
    >
      {data?.map((obj) => (
        <SuiObjectDisplay object={obj.data!}>
        </SuiObjectDisplay>
      ))}
    </InfiniteScrollArea>
  );
}
```
</details>

Fetch the owned objects directly from Sui blockchain using the `useSuiClientInfiniteQuery()` hook from `dApp Kit`. This hook is a thin wrapper around Sui blockchain RPC calls, reference the documentation to learn more about these [RPC hooks](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit/rpc-hooks). Basically, supply the RPC endpoint you want to execute, in this case it's the [`getOwnedObjects` endpoint](https://docs.sui.io/sui-api-ref#suix_getownedobjects). Supply the connected wallet account as the `owner`. The returned data is stored inside the cache at query key `getOwnedObjects`. In a future step you invalidate this cache after a mutation succeeds, so the data will be re-fetched automatically.


<details>
  <summary>
    Next, update `src/routes/LockedDashboard.tsx` to include the `LockOwnedObjects` component:
  </summary>
```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Tabs } from "@radix-ui/themes";
import { LockOwnedObjects } from "@/components/locked/LockOwnedObjects";

export function LockedDashboard() {
  const tabs = [
    {
      name: "Lock Owned objects",
      component: () => <LockOwnedObjects />,
    },
  ];

  const [tab, setTab] = useState(tabs[0].name);

  return (
    <Tabs.Root value={tab} onValueChange={setTab}>
      <Tabs.List>
        {tabs.map((tab, index) => {
          return (
            <Tabs.Trigger
              key={index}
              value={tab.name}
              className="cursor-pointer"
            >
              {tab.name}
            </Tabs.Trigger>
          );
        })}
      </Tabs.List>
      {tabs.map((tab, index) => {
        return (
          <Tabs.Content key={index} value={tab.name}>
            {tab.component()}
          </Tabs.Content>
        );
      })}
    </Tabs.Root>
  );
}
```
</details>

:::checkpoint

Run your app and ensure you can:

- View the owned objects of the connected wallet account.

If you don't see any objects, you might need to create some demo data or connect your wallet. You can mint objects after completing the next steps.

### Execute transaction hook {#execute-transaction-hook}

In the frontend, you might need to execute a transaction block in multiple places, hence it's better to extract the transaction execution logic and reuse it everywhere. Let's create and examine the execute transaction hook.


<details>
  <summary>
    Create `src/hooks/useTransactionExecution.ts`:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/hooks/useTransactionExecution.ts}
</details>

A `Transaction` is the input, sign it with the current connected wallet account, execute the transaction block, return the execution result, and finally display a basic toast message to indicate whether the transaction is successful or not.

Use the `useSuiClient()` hook from `dApp Kit` to retrieve the Sui client instance configured in `src/main.tsx`. The `useSignTransaction()` function is another hook from `dApp kit` that helps to sign the transaction block using the currently connected wallet. It displays the UI for users to review and sign their transactions with their selected wallet. To execute a transaction block, use the `executeTransaction()` on the Sui client instance of the Sui TypeScript SDK.

### Generate demo data

:::info

The full source code of the demo bear smart contract is available at [Trading Contracts Demo directory](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/trading/contracts/demo)

:::

You need a utility function to create a dummy object representing a real world asset so you can use it to test and demonstrate escrow users flow on the UI directly.

<details>
  <summary>
    Create `src/mutations/demo.ts`:
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/mutations/demo.ts}
</details>

As previously mentioned, this example uses `@tanstack/react-query` to query, cache, and mutate server state. Server state is data only available on remote servers, and the only way to retrieve or update this data is by interacting with these remote servers. In this case, it could be from an API or directly from Sui blockchain RPC.

When you execute a transaction call to mutate data on the Sui blockchain, use the `useMutation()` hook. The `useMutation()` hook accepts several inputs, however, you only need two of them for this example. The first parameter, `mutationFn`, accepts the function to execute the main mutating logic, while the second parameter, `onSuccess`, is a callback that runs when the mutating logic succeeds.

The main mutating logic includes executing a Move call of a package named `demo_bear::new` to create a dummy bear object and transferring it to the connected wallet account, all within the same `Transaction`. This example reuses the `executeTransaction()` hook from the [Execute Transaction Hook](#execute-transaction-hook) step to execute the transaction.

Another benefit of wrapping the main mutating logic inside `useMutation()` is that you can access and manipulate the cache storing server state. This example fetches the cache from remote servers by using query call in an appropriate callback. In this case, it is the `onSuccess` callback. When the transaction succeeds, invalidate the cache data at the cache key called `getOwnedObjects`, then `@tanstack/react-query` handles the re-fetching mechanism for the invalidated data automatically. Do this by using `invalidateQueries()` on the `@tanstack/react-query` configured client instance retrieved by `useQueryClient()` hook in the [Set up Routing](#routing) step.

Now the logic to create a dummy bear object exists. You just need to attach it into the button in the header.

<details>
  <summary>
    `Header.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx}
</details>

:::checkpoint

Run your app and ensure you can:

- Mint a demo bear object and view it in the `Manage Objects` tab.

![New bear](./images/trustless-new-bear.png)

:::

### Locking owned objects

To lock the object, execute the `lock` Move function identified by `{PACKAGE_ID}::lock::lock`. The implementation is similar to what's in previous mutation functions, use `useMutation()` from `@tanstack/react-query` to wrap the main logic inside it. The lock function requires an object to be locked and its type because our smart contract `lock` function is generic and requires type parameters. After creating a `Locked` object and its `Key` object, transfer them to the connected wallet account within the same transaction block.

It's beneficial to extract logic of locking owned objects into a separated mutating function to enhance discoverability and encapsulation.

<details>
  <summary>
    Create `src/mutations/locked.ts`:
  </summary>
```tsx
import { CONSTANTS } from "@/constants";
import { useTransactionExecution } from "@/hooks/useTransactionExecution";
import { useCurrentAccount } from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { SuiObjectData } from "@mysten/sui/client";
import { Transaction } from "@mysten/sui/transactions";
import { useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
/**
 * Builds and executes the PTB to lock an object.
 */
export function useLockObjectMutation() {
  const account = useCurrentAccount();
  const executeTransaction = useTransactionExecution();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async ({ object }: { object: SuiObjectData }) => {
      if (!account?.address)
        throw new Error("You need to connect your wallet!");
      const txb = new Transaction();

      const [locked, key] = txb.moveCall({
        target: `${CONSTANTS.escrowContract.packageId}::lock::lock`,
        arguments: [txb.object(object.objectId)],
        typeArguments: [object.type!],
      });

      txb.transferObjects([locked, key], txb.pure.address(account.address));

      return executeTransaction(txb);
    },
  });
}
```
</details>

Update `src/components/locked/LockOwnedObjects.tsx` to include the `useLockObjectMutation` hook:

<details>
  <summary>
    `LockOwnedObjects.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/locked/LockOwnedObjects.tsx}
</details>

:::checkpoint

Run your app and ensure you can:

- Lock an owned object. 

The object should disappear from the list of owned objects. You view and unlock locked objects in later steps.

![Lock bear](./images/trustless-lock-bear.png)

:::

### Display owned locked objects

Let's take a look at the **My Locked Objects** tab by examining `src/components/locked/OwnedLockedList.tsx`. Focus on the logic on how to retrieve this list.

<details>
  <summary>
    `OwnedLockedList.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/locked/OwnedLockedList.tsx}
</details>

This instance of `useSuiClientInfiniteQuery()` is similar to the one in the `LockOwnedObjects` component. The difference is that it fetches the locked objects instead of the owned objects. The `Locked` object is a struct type in the smart contract, so you need to supply the struct type to the query call as a `filter`. The struct type is usually identified by the format of `{PACKAGE_ID}::{MODULE_NAME}::{STRUCT_TYPE}`.

##### `LockedObject` and `Locked` component

The `<LockedObject />` (`src/components/locked/LockedObject.tsx`) component is mainly responsible for mapping an on-chain `SuiObjectData` `Locked` object to its corresponding `ApiLockedObject`, which is finally delegated to the `<Locked />` component for rendering. The `<LockedObject />` fetches the locked item object ID if the prop `itemId` is not supplied by using `dApp Kit` `useSuiClientQuery()` hook to call the `getDynamicFieldObject` RPC endpoint. Recalling that in this smart contract, the locked item is put into a dynamic object field.

<details>
  <summary>
    `LockedObject.tsx`
  </summary>
  {@inject: examples/trading/frontend/src/components/locked/LockedObject.tsx}
</details>

The `<Locked />` (`src/components/locked/partials/Locked.tsx`) component is mainly responsible for rendering the `ApiLockedObject`. Later on, it will also consist of several on-chain interactions: unlock the locked objects and create an escrow out of the locked object.

<details>
  <summary>
    `Locked.tsx`
  </summary>
```tsx
import { useCurrentAccount, useSuiClientQuery } from "@mysten/dapp-kit";
import { SuiObjectDisplay } from "@/components/SuiObjectDisplay";
import { ExplorerLink } from "../../ExplorerLink";
import { ApiLockedObject } from "@/types/types";

/**
 * Prefer to use the `Locked` component only through `LockedObject`.
 *
 * This can also render data directly from the API, but we prefer
 * to also validate ownership from on-chain state (as objects are transferrable)
 * and the API cannot track all the ownership changes.
 */
export function Locked({
  locked,
  hideControls,
}: {
  locked: ApiLockedObject;
  hideControls?: boolean;
}) {
  const account = useCurrentAccount();

  const suiObject = useSuiClientQuery(
    "getObject",
    {
      id: locked.itemId,
      options: {

        showType: true,

      },
    },
    {
      select: (data) => data.data,
    },
  );

  const getLabel = () => {
    if (locked.deleted) return "Deleted";
    if (hideControls) {
      if (locked.creator === account?.address) return "You offer this";
      return "You'll receive this if accepted";
    }
    return undefined;
  };

  const getLabelClasses = () => {
    if (locked.deleted)
      return "bg-red-50 rounded px-3 py-1 text-sm text-red-500";
    if (hideControls) {
      if (!!locked.creator && locked.creator === account?.address)
        return "bg-blue-50 rounded px-3 py-1 text-sm text-blue-500";
      return "bg-green-50 rounded px-3 py-1 text-sm text-green-700";
    }
    return undefined;
  };

  return (
    <SuiObjectDisplay
      object={suiObject.data!}
      label={getLabel()}
      labelClasses={getLabelClasses()}
    >
      <div className="p-4 pt-1 text-right flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between">

### Unlocking owned objects

To unlock the object, execute the `unlock` Move function identified by `{PACKAGE_ID}::lock::unlock`. Call the `unlock` function supplying the `Locked` object, its corresponding `Key`, the struct type of the original object, and transfer the unlocked object to the current connected wallet account. Also, implement the `onSuccess` callback to invalidate the cache data at query key `locked` after one second to force `react-query` to re-fetch the data at corresponding query key automatically.

Unlocking owned objects is another crucial and complex on-chain action in this application. Hence, it's beneficial to extract its logic into separated mutating functions to enhance discoverability and encapsulation.

</details>

This hook fetches all the non-deleted system `Locked` objects from the API in a paginated fashion. Then, it proceeds into fetching the on-chain state, to ensure the latest state of the object is displayed.

This component uses tanstack's `useInfiniteQuery` instead of `useSuiClientInfiniteQuery` since the data is being fetched from the example's API rather than Sui.

### Create escrows

To create escrows, include a mutating function through the `useCreateEscrowMutation` hook in `src/mutations/escrow.ts`. It accepts the escrowed item to be traded and the `ApiLockedObject` from another party as parameters. Then, call the `{PACKAGE_ID}::shared::create` Move function and provide the escrowed item, the key id of the locked object to exchange, and the recipient of the escrow (locked object's owner).

      if (!currentAccount?.address)
        throw new Error("You need to connect your wallet!");

      const txb = new Transaction();
      txb.moveCall({
        target: `${CONSTANTS.escrowContract.packageId}::shared::create`,
        arguments: [
          txb.object(object.objectId!),
          txb.pure.id(locked.keyId),

### Cancel escrows

To cancel the escrow, create a mutation through the `useCancelEscrowMutation` hook in `src/mutations/escrow.ts`. The cancel function accepts the escrow `ApiEscrowObject` and its on-chain data. The `{PACKAGE_ID}::shared::return_to_sender` Move call is generic, thus it requires the type parameters of the escrowed object. Next, execute `{PACKAGE_ID}::shared::return_to_sender` and transfer the returned escrowed object to the creator of the escrow.

### Accept escrows

To accept the escrow, create a mutation through the `useAcceptEscrowMutation` hook in `src/mutations/escrow.ts`. The implementation should be fairly familiar to you now. The accept function accepts the escrow `ApiEscrowObject` and the locked object `ApiLockedObject`. The `{PACKAGE_ID}::shared::swap` Move call is generic, thus it requires the type parameters of the escrowed and locked objects. Query the objects details by using `multiGetObjects` on Sui client instance. Lastly, execute the `{PACKAGE_ID}::shared::swap` Move call and transfer the returned escrowed item to the connected wallet account. When the mutation succeeds, invalidate the cache to allow automatic re-fetch of the data.

Run your app and ensure you can:

- Accept an escrow that someone else requested.

### Finished frontend

At this point, you have a fully functional frontend that allows users to discover trades and interact with listed escrows. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the application. Have fun exploring the app and testing out the different features!
