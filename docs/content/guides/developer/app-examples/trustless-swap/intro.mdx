## What you'll make

In this guide, you will make an app that performs atomic swaps on Sui. Atomic swaps are similar to escrows but without requiring a trusted third party.

The guide is split into three parts:

1. [Smart Contracts](./smart-contracts.mdx): The Move code that holds the state and perform the swaps.
1. [Backend](./backend.mdx): A service that indexes chain state to discover trades, and an API service to read this data.
1. [Frontend](./frontend.mdx): A UI that enables users to list objects for sale and to accept trades.

## What you'll learn

- **Shared objects.** You'll learn how to use [shared objects](../../../../concepts/object-ownership/shared.mdx), in this case to act as the escrow between two Sui users wanting to trade. Shared objects are a unique concept to Sui. Any transaction and any signer can modify it, given the changes meet the requirements set forth by the package that defined the type.
- **Composability.** You'll learn how to design your Move code in a way that enables full composability. In this app, the Move code that handles trading is completely unaware of the code that defines the objects it is trading and vice versa.

You will also learn how to build an app that:

- **Is trustless.** Users do not have to trust (or pay) any third parties; the chain manages the swap.
- **Avoids rug-pulls.** It is guaranteed that the object a user wants to trade for isn't tampered with after initiating the trade.
- **Preserves liveness.** Users are able to pull out of the trade and reclaim their object at any time, in case the other party stops responding.

## What you'll need

{@include: ../../../../snippets/app-examples-swap-source.mdx}

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Installed the latest version of Sui](../../getting-started/sui-install.mdx).
- [Configured a valid network environment](../../../../references/cli/client.mdx#set-current-environment), as you will be deploying the module on Testnet.
- Read the basics of [shared versus owned objects](../../sui-101/shared-owned.mdx).
