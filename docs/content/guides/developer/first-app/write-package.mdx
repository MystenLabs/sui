title: Write a Move Package
description: The first step in getting a package on chain is to write the Move code that defines the logic of your package. The structure of a Move package is similar to those in Rust.
---

To begin, open a terminal or console at the location you plan to store your package. Use the `sui move new` command to create an empty Move package with the name `my_first_package`:

```sh
$ sui move new my_first_package
```

Running the previous command creates a directory with the name you provide (`my_first_package` in this case). The command populates the new directory with a skeleton Move project that consists of a `sources` directory and a `Move.toml` manifest file. Open the manifest with a text editor to review its contents:

{@inject: examples/move/first_package/Move.toml}

The manifest file contents include available sections of the manifest and comments that provide additional information. In Move, you prepend the hash mark (`#`) to a line to denote a comment.

- **[package]:** Contains metadata for the package. By default, the `sui move new` command populates only the `name` value of the metadata. In this case, the example passes `my_first_package` to the command, which becomes the name of the package. You can delete the first `#` of subsequent lines of the `[package]` section to provide values for the other available metadata fields.
- **[dependencies]:** Lists the other packages that your package depends on to run. By default, the `sui move new` command lists the `Sui` package on GitHub (Testnet version) as the lone dependency.
- **[addresses]:** Declares named addresses that your package uses. By default, the section includes the package you create with the `sui move new` command and an address of `0x0`. This value can be left as-is and indicates that [package addresses are automatically managed](../../../../concepts/sui-move-concepts/packages/automated-address-management) when published and upgraded.
- **[dev-dependencies]:** Includes only comments that describe the section.
- **[dev-addresses]:** Includes only comments that describe the section.

### Defining the package

You have a package now but it doesn't do anything. To make your package useful, you must add logic contained in `.move` source files that define _modules_. Use a text editor or the command line to create your first package source file named `my_module.move` in the `sources` directory of the package:

```sh
$ touch my_first_package/sources/my_module.move
```

Populate the `my_module.move` file with the following code:

{@inject: examples/move/first_package/sources/example.move#first noTests}

The comments in the preceding code highlight different parts of a typical Move source file.

- **Part 1: Imports** - Code reuse is a necessity in modern programming. Move supports this concept with `use` aliases that allow your module to refer to types and functions declared in other modules. In this example, the module imports from `object`, `transfer`, and `tx_context` modules, but it does not need to do so explicitly, because the compiler provides these `use` statements by default. These modules are available to the package because the `Move.toml` file defines the Sui dependency (along with the `sui` named address) where they are defined.

- **Part 2: Struct declarations** - Structs define types that a module can create or destroy. Struct definitions can include abilities provided with the `has` keyword. The structs in this example, for instance, have the `key` ability, which indicates that these structs are Sui objects that you can transfer between addresses. The `store` ability on the structs provides the ability to appear in other struct fields and be transferred freely.

- **Part 3: Module initializer** - A special function that is invoked exactly once when the module publishes.

- **Part 4: Accessor functions** - These functions allow the fields of the module's structs to be read from other modules.

After you save the file, you have a complete Move package.
