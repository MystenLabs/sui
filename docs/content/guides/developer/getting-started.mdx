Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that Sui addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption. 

Before you can get started developing on Sui, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries. 

## Install Sui 

{@include: ../../snippets/quick-install.mdx}

You can also install Sui from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install Sui page.

Go to [Install Sui](./getting-started/sui-install.mdx).

## After installing Sui

After you have Sui installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts. 

- [Connect to a Sui Network](./getting-started/connect.mdx)
- [Connect to a Local Network](./getting-started/local-network.mdx)
- [Get Sui Address](./getting-started/get-address.mdx)
- [Get SUI Coins](./getting-started/get-coins.mdx)

## GraphQL queries

Use the GraphQL service for Sui RPC to interact with on-chain data. 

Go to [Query Sui RPC with GraphQL](./getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx).
