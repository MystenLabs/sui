## Create a Sui address

An _address_ is a unique, anonymous identity on a blockchain network. On Sui, an address specifically represents a location on-chain that owns objects. Addresses on Sui are used for:

- Holding and sending tokens 

- Owning objects like NFTs and Move packages

- Submitting transactions and interacting with smart contracts

You do not need to provide any personally identifying information to create an address. A single individual can create and own multiple addresses. 

Every Sui address is a unique 32-byte identifier and is often encoded in hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix. For example:

```
0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331
```

Every address is derived from a public key generated using a cryptographic hash function. Each public key has a corresponding private key that is used to access the address and the objects that it owns. An address and its associated key together is an _account_. 

[Learn more about how a Sui address is derived and other cryptography related topics](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/keys-addresses.mdx).

## Obtain a Sui address 

:::caution 

If you already created a new address in [configure a Sui client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client.mdx), you can skip to [Using the Testnet SUI faucet](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx) to continue the onboarding steps.

- [x] [Configure your Sui client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, when the Sui client runs for the first time, it will prompt you to [configure the client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client.mdx). This initial configuration generates a new Sui address, its key pair, and its associated secret recovery phrase. Make sure you write down the secret recovery phrase and store it in a safe place. 

To create a new Sui address outside of the initial client configuration, run:

```
$ sui client new-address ed25519
```

This command specifies the key pair scheme to be of type `ed25519`.

### Recovery phrases

Every Sui address has a _recovery phrase_. Recovery phrases are a series of 12 randomly generated words that are used to recover the address if you lose access to the address's key pair. Recovery phrases should be stored securely and should not be shared with anyone, as it provides access to any objects and tokens that the address owns.

To recover an address using the recovery phrase, use the command:

```
sui client import-address
```

Then, enter the 12 word recovery phrase. The words must be entered in the correct order. If successful, the CLI will restore your address and print it in the CLI output.

## `sui.keystore`

Every Sui address will have a private key stored in either the  `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` or `%USERPROFILE/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` file on macOS/Linux or Windows systems, respectively.

This file will contain content similar to the following:

```
[
  "AK6q1/Yzz5qmTfHGLot4wkbRP5lP5NUQVDlf3FggLrKZ",
  "ADAWAFS+J9KcDjFmAiVI/e9ZluG0id9AnI6a7Bk5tH+G",
  "AJ42rQfCrPIfrQvzCgeHVDCcQZ4R1qAzKtob61VTw5k5",
  "AHoKrY7DDnUOq2RgP7gXLPa86bFfzqEMvmOs7TmHtST+"
]
```

When a new address is created on your system, a new line will be added to this file that consists of the address's private key. Make sure you do not expose this to anyone, as they can use it to get access to your account.


Purpose of Task:
A separate chapter should be added to clearly explain the connection between the addresses managed by the local keystore in the local PC and the sui.keystore file. 
Users must understand the fact that only addresses imported to local keystore can be used for local transactions.

## View all local Sui addresses

The _active address_ is the address the Sui client is currently using. This address will be the owner of any objects you create and transactions you submit, unless otherwise specified with an `--address` flag in a command. 

To view the current active address, use the command:

```
$ sui client active-address
```

To view all addresses on your local machine, run:

```
$ sui keytool list
```

This will return all addresses, along with their alias, public key, key scheme, and peer ID.

```

For more information about the keytool command, see the [Sui Keytool CLI](/references/cli/keytool.mdx) documentation.

### Change the active address 

If you want to switch to another address, first confirm which address is the active address and which addresses are available for you to switch to:

```
$ sui client addresses
```

This will return all available addresses, their alias, and it will indicate which is the currently active address:

```
╭───────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────╮
│ alias                 │ address                                                            │ active address │

╰───────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────╯
```

Then, to switch to another address, use the command:

```
$ sui client switch --address <ADDRESS>
```

## Query information about an address 

You can use a Sui network explorer to find more information about an address, its token balances, and the objects it owns. Popular Sui explorers include:

- [SuiVision](https://suivision.xyz/)

- [SuiScan](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/accounts)

:::danger

Data displayed on an explorer will differ depending on which network your address was created on. If you've followed the [Configure a Sui Client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client.mdx) page previously, you will most likely be using the Sui Testnet. Be sure to select the Testnet network on the Sui explorer, such as https://testnet.suivision.xyz/

:::

From the CLI, you can view all objects an address owns with the command:

```
$ sui client objects <ADDRESS>
```

## Next steps 

Next, [obtain Testnet SUI tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx) from the Testnet SUI faucet.

If you already have Testnet SUI, then you're ready to [deploy Hello, world!](/guides/developer/getting-started/hello-world.mdx).
