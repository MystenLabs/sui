To perform transactions on a Sui network, you need SUI coins to pay for gas and storage. 

On Mainnet, you buy SUI on exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, or Robinhood. Its value is determined by market factors such as supply and demand, network utility, and perceived value.

Because Mainnet coins cost real money, development can be expensive. That's why Sui provides Devnet and Testnet networks, which mirror Mainnet features and enables you to build and test safely.

:::important

SUI on Devnet and Testnet is free and holds no monetary value.

:::

You can get free test tokens from the Sui faucet, which lets you deploy and interact with programs on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network.

```sh
$ sui client
```

If this is the first time running the `sui client` CLI tool, it asks you to provide a Sui full node server URL and a meaningful environment alias. It also generates an address with a random key pair in `sui.keystore` and a config `client.yaml`.

By default, the `client.yaml` and `sui.keystore` files are located in `~/.sui/sui_config`. For more information, refer to the [Sui client CLI tutorial](/references/cli/client.mdx).

If this is not your first time running `sui client`, then you already have a `client.yaml` file in your local environment. If you'd like to create a new address for this tutorial, use the command:

```sh 
$ sui client new-address ed25519
```

## Request test tokens {#online-faucet}

Visit the online faucet to request SUI tokens.

https://faucet.sui.io/

How to use:

1. Connect your wallet or paste your wallet address in the address field.
1. Use the network dropdown to select the correct network.
1. Click the **Request SUI** button. 

To request more SUI, refresh your browser and click the Request SUI button again. The requests are rate limited, however, so too many requests results in a waiting period before you are able to request more tokens.

### Return unused Testnet SUI

The Testnet faucet drains from a finite pool of SUI. If the pool empties, it disrupts faucet service for the rest of the community. To help ensure this doesn't happen, you can use the online faucet to return your unused SUI to the pool.

There are two ways to return unused Testnet SUI:

- Connect your wallet to the online faucet, and click the **Return tokens to faucet** button. Approve the transaction using your wallet and your Testnet SUI are returned to the pool.
- If you prefer not to connect your wallet, click the **Copy** button to the right of the return address and send the tokens via a separate transaction.

## Alternative methods for getting test SUI

If you need an alternative method to get test SUI, you have several options.

:::tip

Every method to retrieve Testnet and Devnet SUI is rate limited. If you need a large amount of SUI, use a local network.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Use the [Sui CLI](../../../references/cli/client.mdx) to request tokens for your address on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network. `sui client faucet` uses the active network and active address that is currently set in the Sui CLI, but you can specify custom data through the following two arguments:

- `--address` argument to provide a specific address (or its alias),
- `--url` argument to provide a custom faucet endpoint.

<TabItem value="discord" label="Discord">

1. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/sui).
   
   If you try to join the Sui Discord channel using a newly created Discord account, you might need to wait a few days for validation.
1. Request test SUI tokens in the Sui [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels. Send the following message to the channel, replacing `<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>` with your client address:
   ```sh
   !faucet <YOUR SUI ADDRESS>
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="slush" label="Slush wallet">

You can request test tokens within [Slush](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slush-%E2%80%94-a-sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

Use the following cURL commands to set console variables and request tokens directly from the faucet server. Set `NETWORK` to `devnet` if using that network.

```sh
$ ADDRESS=$(sui client active-address)
$ NETWORK=testnet
$ curl --location --request POST "https://faucet.${NETWORK}.sui.io/v2/gas" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-raw "{
    \"FixedAmountRequest\": {
        \"recipient\": \"${ADDRESS}\"
    }
}"
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `"https://faucet.${NETWORK}.sui.io/v2/gas"` with the appropriate value based on which package runs your network:

- `sui-faucet`: `http://127.0.0.1:5003/gas`
- `sui`: `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript SDK">

You can access the faucet using the [Sui TypeScript SDK](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript).

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV2 } from '@mysten/sui/faucet';

// get tokens from the Devnet faucet server
await requestSuiFromFaucetV2({
	// connect to Devnet
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>',
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test tokens on a local network

If you are running a local Sui network, you can get tokens from your local faucet. See the [Connect to a Local Network](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) topic for details.

## Next steps

Now that you have SUI for gas, you can publish smart contracts. Try out one of the beginner projects:
