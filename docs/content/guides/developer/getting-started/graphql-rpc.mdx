:::

The quickest way to access the GraphQL service for Sui RPC is through the online IDE that provides a complete toolbox for fetching data and executing transactions on the network. The online IDE provides features such as auto-completion (use Ctrl+Space or just start typing), built-in documentation (Book icon, top-left), multi-tabs, and more.

The online IDE is available for [Mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [Testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql). This guide contains various queries that you can try directly in the IDE.

:::info
- Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to `mainnet` data only.
- Both [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) services are rate-limited to keep network throughput optimized.
:::

For more details about some concepts used in the examples below, please see the [GraphQL concepts](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx) page, and consult the [reference](../../../references/sui-graphql.mdx) for full documentation on the supported schema.


## Discovering the schema

GraphQL introspection exposes the schema supported by the RPC service. The IDE's "Docs" pane (Book icon, top-left) and Search dialog (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> on Windows and Linux) offer a way to browse introspection output interactively.

The [official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) provides an overview on introspection, and how to interact with it programmatically.

## Finding the reference gas price for latest epoch

```graphql
query {
  epoch {
    referenceGasPrice
  }
}
```

## Finding information about a specific historical epoch

This example finds the total stake rewards, the reference gas price, the number of checkpoints and the total gas fees for epoch 100. Note that in the query, the `id` argument is optional, and defaults to the latest epoch.

```graphql
query {
  epoch(id: 100) # note that id is optional, and without it, latest epoch is returned
  {
    epochId
    totalStakeRewards
    referenceGasPrice
    totalCheckpoints
    totalGasFees
    totalStakeSubsidies
    storageFund {
      totalObjectStorageRebates
      nonRefundableBalance
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding a transaction block by its digest

This example gets a transaction block by its digest and shows information such as the gas sponsor's address, the gas price, the gas budget, and effects from executing that transaction block.

```graphql
query {
  transactionBlock(digest: "FdKFgsQ9iRrxW6b1dh9WPGuNuaJWMXHJn1wqBQSqVqK2") {
    gasInput {
      gasSponsor {
        address
      }
      gasPrice
      gasBudget
    }
    effects {
      status
      timestamp
      checkpoint {
        sequenceNumber
      }
      epoch {
        epochId
        referenceGasPrice
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding the last ten transactions that are not a system transaction

```graphql
query {
  transactionBlocks(last: 10, filter: {kind: PROGRAMMABLE_TX}) {
    nodes {
      digest
      kind {
        __typename
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding all transactions that touched a given object

This example finds all the transactions that touched (modified/transferred/deleted) a given object. This is useful for when we want to trace the flow of a Coin/StakeSui/NFT.

:::info
This example uses GraphQL [variables](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#variables) and [pagination](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#pagination). When using the online IDE, copy the variables JSON to the "Variables" window, below the main editor.
:::

```graphql
query ($objectID: SuiAddress!) {
  transactionBlocks(filter: {changedObject: $objectID}) {
    nodes {
      sender {
        address
      }
      digest
      effects {
        objectChanges {
          nodes {
            address
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables**:
```json
{
  "objectID": "0x11c6ae8432156527fc2e12e05ac7db79f2e972510a823a4ef2e670f27ad7b52f"
}
```

## Filtering transaction blocks by a function

This example finds the last ten transaction blocks that called the `public_transfer` function, (as a move call transaction command).

:::info
This example makes usage of the filter `last`, which indicates that the user only wants the last ten transaction blocks known to the service.
:::

```graphql
{
  transactionBlocks(
    last: 10,
      filter: {
        function: "0x2::transfer::public_transfer"
      }
  ) {
    nodes { digest }
  }
}
```

## Finding transaction balance changes

This example finds the balance changes of all the transactions where a given address called a staking-related function. This is useful when you want to get your staking or unstaking history.

```graphql
query ($address: SuiAddress!) {
  transactionBlocks(filter: {
    function: "0x3::sui_system::request_add_stake"
    sentAddress: $address
  }) {
    nodes {
      digest
      effects {
        balanceChanges {
          nodes {
            owner {
              address
            }
            amount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables**:
```json
{
  "address": "0xa9ad44383140a07cc9ea62d185c12c4d9ef9c6a8fd2f47e16316229815862d23"
}
```

## Fetching a dynamic field on an object

:::info
This example uses aliases and [fragments](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#fragments).
:::

```graphql
query DynamicField {
  object(
    address: "0xb57fba584a700a5bcb40991e1b2e6bf68b0f3896d767a0da92e69de73de226ac"
  ) {
    dynamicField(
      name: {
        type: "0x2::kiosk::Listing",
        bcs: "NLArx1UJguOUYmXgNG8Pv8KbKXLjWtCi6i0Yeq1VhfwA",
      }
    ) {
      ...DynamicFieldSelect
    }
  }
}

fragment DynamicFieldSelect on DynamicField {
  name {
    ...MoveValueFields
  }
  value {
    ...DynamicFieldValueSelection
  }
}

fragment DynamicFieldValueSelection on DynamicFieldValue {
  __typename
  ... on MoveValue {
    ...MoveValueFields
  }
  ... on MoveObject {
    hasPublicTransfer
    contents {
      ...MoveValueFields
    }
  }
}

fragment MoveValueFields on MoveValue {
  type {
    repr
  }
  data
  bcs
}
```

## Fetching all dynamic fields on an object

This query can be used to paginate over the dynamic fields of an object. This works even when the object in question is [wrapped](../../../concepts/object-ownership/wrapped.mdx), by using the <a href="/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/queries/owner" data-noBrokenLinkCheck='true'>owner</a> query, so can be used for iterating over the elements of on-chain data structures, like [Tables and Bags](../../../concepts/dynamic-fields/tables-bags.mdx).

:::info
This example uses [fragments](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#fragments) and [variables](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#variables).
:::

```graphql
query ($id: SuiAddress!) {
  owner(address: $id) {
    dynamicFields {
      nodes {
        name { ...Value }
        value {
          __typename
          ... on MoveValue {
            ...Value
          }
          ... on MoveObject {
            contents {
              ...Value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

fragment Value on MoveValue {
  type {
    repr
  }
  json
}
```

## Paginating checkpoints forward, five at a time {#page-forward}

```graphql
query ($after: String) {
  checkpoints(first: 5, after: $after) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
    nodes {
      digest
      timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the genesis checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in increasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasNextPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.endCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$after`.

:::info

This example uses GraphQL [variables](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#variables) and [pagination](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#pagination).

:::

## Paginating checkpoints backwards, five at a time {#page-back}

```graphql
query ($before: String) {
  checkpoints(last: 5, before: $before) {
    pageInfo {
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
    nodes {
      digest
      timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

Sets up a paginated query, starting at the latest indexed checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time, in decreasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasPreviousPage` determines whether there is another page to be read, and the value of `pageInfo.startCursor` is fed back in as the cursor to read `$before`.

:::info
This example uses GraphQL [variables](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#variables) and [pagination](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#pagination).
:::

## Executing a transaction

Transaction execution takes in two arguments, `txBytes` and `signatures`. `txBytes` is the serialized unsigned transaction data, which can be generated when using the Sui CLI's `client call` [command](../../../references/cli/client.mdx), to call a Move function by passing the `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag. The `signatures` can be generated using Sui CLI's [keytool](../../../references/cli/keytool.mdx) command `sui keytool sign`. More information on Sui CLI can be found [here](/references/cli).

```graphql
mutation ($tx: String!, $sigs: [String!]!) {
  executeTransactionBlock(txBytes: $tx, signatures: $sigs) {
    errors
    effects {
      status
      epoch {
        startTimestamp
      }
      gasEffects {
        gasSummary {
          computationCost
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables**:
```json
{
  "tx": "AAACACAZXApmrHgzTs3FGDyXWka+wmMCy2IwOdKLmTWHb5PnFQEASlCnLAw4qfzLF3unH9or5/L7YpOlReaSEWfoEwhTqpavSxAAAAAAACCUFUCOn8ljIxcG9O+CA1bzqjunqr4DLDSzSoNCkUvu2AEBAQEBAAEAALNQHmLi4jgC5MuwwmiMvZEeV5kuyh+waCS60voE7fpzAa3v/tOFuqDvQ+bjBpKTfjyL+6yIg+5eC3dKReVwghH/rksQAAAAAAAgxtZtKhXTr1zeFAo1JzEqVKn9J1H74ddbCJNVZGo2I1izUB5i4uI4AuTLsMJojL2RHleZLsofsGgkutL6BO36c+gDAAAAAAAAQEIPAAAAAAAA",

  ]
}
```
