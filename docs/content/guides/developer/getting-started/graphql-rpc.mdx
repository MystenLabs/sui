:::

The quickest way to access the GraphQL service for Sui RPC is through the online IDE that provides a complete toolbox for fetching data and executing transactions on the network. The online IDE provides features such as auto-completion (use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> or just start typing), built-in documentation (Book icon, top-left), multi-tabs, and more.

The online IDE is available for Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet. You can try the various queries on this page directly in the IDE.

:::info

Both Mainnet and Testnet services are rate-limited to keep network throughput optimized.

:::

- Mainnet: https://graphql.mainnet.sui.io/graphql
- Testnet: https://graphql.testnet.sui.io/graphql
- Devnet: https://graphql.devnet.sui.io/graphql

:::caution

Switch any apps that still use the GraphQL Alpha endpoints (`https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql`, `https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql`, and `https://sui-devnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql`) as soon as possible. Migrate your apps to the GraphQL Beta endpoints to avoid disruption of service.

:::

For more details about some concepts used in the following examples, see the [GraphQL concepts](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx) page. Consult the [GraphQL reference](../../../references/sui-graphql.mdx) for full documentation on the supported schema.

## Discovering the schema

GraphQL introspection exposes the schema supported by the RPC service. The IDE's **Docs** pane (Book icon, top-left) and **Search** dialog (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Windows and Linux) offer a way to browse introspection output interactively.

The [official GraphQL introspection documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) provides an overview on introspection and how to interact with it programmatically.

## Beta schema changes

Some of the schema updates for the beta version include:

### Renames and deprecations

- `TransactionBlock` is being replaced with `Transaction`
- `Owner` has been merged with `Address`
- `dryRunTransactionBlock` is being replaced with `simulateTransaction`
- `bcs` fields are qualified with the type of BCS data they hold, to avoid confusion.
- `changedObject` and `inputObject` filters in `transactions` query are being replaced with `affectedObject`.
- `address.coins` and `address.stakedSuis` are being deprecated in favor of `address.objects` with the corresponding `type` filter.
- `MoveValue.data` has been deprecated because it does not add value over `MoveValue.json`, which provides a more clear representation of the data.

### Consistency

GraphQL Beta offers the ability to run a query at a fixed checkpoint (retention permitting). This allows clients to query the chain state at a particular snapshot in time over multiple arbitrary requests (GraphQL Alpha offered consistency across multiple requests as long as they were for pages of a paginated query).

### Versioning

APIs for traversing different versions of packages and objects have been added. You can now list a package or object's versions, or go from one version of a package or object to another version by number, or the latest version.

### Splitting up query APIs

Paginated query APIs were previously responsible for three kinds of query pattern, which will be broken up into two separate APIs:

- A dedicated multi-get API that accepts a list of keys and returns a list of results.
- A query API that offers the original core functionality: Efficient paginated results without having to supply a checkpoint range, but for limited combinations of filters.

### Relaxed consistency cursors

Cursors in GraphQL Alpha indicated the checkpoint that pagination started at. Future pages would be fetched as if from this checkpoint. This is helpful for paginating owned objects of an address, but cannot express queries that update over time (like tracking a stream of events in real time). Cursors in GraphQL Beta have relaxed this constraint â€” only cursors for pages whose results do not flow in the same direction as time (such as owned object queries) remember their checkpoint.

The old behavior is reproducible by explicitly setting the checkpoint to query from (see the [Consistency](#consistency) section).

### Preserving Entity IDs

The service retains the ability to identify entities that have been pruned when they are referred to be other entities. For example, even if an object's previous transaction has been pruned, the service is still able to return the transaction digest.

### Unpruned point lookups

Point look-ups are generally unpruned, if GraphQL has access to an Archival Service.

### More detailed retention API

The service provides more details about the retention of its underlying data through the `ServiceConfig.retention` field.

### Governance

APIs related to governance and staking are removed in favor of using view functions to access the data at its source of truth on-chain.

## Example queries

The following queries show some common tasks you can perform with GraphQL.

### Find the reference gas price for latest epoch

<Tabs groupId="graphql">
<TabItem label="Beta" value="beta">
```graphql
query {
  epoch {
    referenceGasPrice
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Alpha (deprecated)" value="alpha">
```graphql
query {
  epoch {
    referenceGasPrice
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Find a specific historical epoch

Find the total stake rewards, the reference gas price, the number of checkpoints and the total gas fees for epoch 100. In the query, the `epochId` argument is optional and defaults to the latest epoch.

<Tabs groupId="graphql">
<TabItem label="Beta" value="beta">

```

### Filter transactions by a function

### Fetch all dynamic fields on an object

Paginate over the dynamic fields of an object. This works even when the object in question is [wrapped](../../../concepts/object-ownership/wrapped.mdx) by using the <a href="/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/queries/owner" data-noBrokenLinkCheck='true'>owner</a> query. Can be used for iterating over the elements of on-chain data structures, like tables and bags. See [The Move Book](https://move-book.com/programmability/dynamic-collections.html) to learn more about dynamic collections available in Move.

### Paginate checkpoints forward five at a time {#page-forward}

Set up a paginated query starting at the genesis checkpoint, reading five checkpoints at a time in increasing order of sequence number. The value of `pageInfo.hasNextPage` determines whether there is another page to read. The value of `pageInfo.endCursor` is used as the cursor to read `$after`.

This example uses GraphQL [variables](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#variables) and [pagination](../../../concepts/graphql-rpc.mdx#pagination).

### Execute a transaction

Transaction execution takes two arguments, `transactionDataBcs` and `signatures`. `transactionDataBcs` is the serialized unsigned transaction data, which the [Sui Client CLI](../../../references/cli/client.mdx) `client call` command can generate. Pass the `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag to the command to call a Move function. The [Sui Keytool CLI](../../../references/cli/keytool.mdx) command `sui keytool sign` can generate the `signatures`.

## New features

The previous examples show GraphQL calls that perform the same function as their JSON-RPC equivalent. There is functionality available to GraphQL that can't be replicated with JSON-RPC, such as: 

- Time travel queries with checkpoint `{ query { ... } }`.
- Nested dynamic field look-ups (and paginating dynamic fields with their contents in one request).
- Fetching live objects by owner kind and type (such as all shared objects of a certain type).
- Fetching deserialized input and output object contents from a transaction that has just executed.

The following examples demonstrate some of the functions not available with JSON-RPC.

### Example 4: Getting objects by type

Fetch the latest versions of objects of type `0x2::package::Publisher` that are currently live on-chain.

```graphql
query {
  objects(filter: { type: "0x2::package::Publisher" }) {
    nodes {
      address
      digest
      asMoveObject {
        contents { json }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 5: Paging through package versions

Find all versions of the Sui framework and list their modules:

```graphql
query {
  packageVersions(address: "0x2") {
    nodes {
      version
      modules {
        nodes {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
```
