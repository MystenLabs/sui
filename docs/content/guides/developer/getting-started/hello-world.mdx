## Installing Sui developer tools

If you use VSCode, you can install the [Move extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move) to get language server support for Move, as well as support for building, testing, and debugging Move code within the IDE.
You can install the extension either by searching the fully-qualified extension name, `Mysten.move`, in the extension view, or by pressing `Ctrl-P` or `Cmd-P` and typing `ext install mysten.move`.
Installing the Move extension also installs the appropriate `move-analyzer` binary for your operating system, as well as the [Move Trace Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move-trace-debug) extension, and [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax) extension.
