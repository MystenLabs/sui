<TabItem label="macOS" value="macos">

- [x] Download and install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

    - If you have Rust installed, update to the latest version: `rustup update stable`

- [x] Download and install Cargo: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

- [x] Download and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

- [x] Download and install [cURL](https://curl.se): `brew install curl`. Verify installation with `curl --version`

These prerequisites use the `apt` package manager for Linux. Adjust the commands accordingly per your package manager.

- [x] Download and install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

    - If you have Rust installed, update to the latest version: `rustup update stable`

- [x] Download and install Cargo: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

- [x] Download and install cURL: `sudo apt-get install curl`. Verify installation with `curl --version`

- [x] Download and install **libssl-dev**: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`.
    
    - If the version of Linux you use doesn't support **libssl-dev**, find an equivalent package for it on the [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/d/libssl-dev/).

    - If you have OpenSSL you might also need to also install **pkg-config**: `sudo apt-get install pkg-config`

- [x] Download and install **libclang-dev**: `sudo apt-get install libclang-dev`

    - If the version of Linux you use doesn't support **libclang-dev**, find an equivalent package for it on the [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/d/libclang-dev/).

- [x] If you plan to use the `--with-indexer` and `--with-graphql` options with `sui start`, download and install **libpq-dev**: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`

    - See [Local Network](/guides/developer/sui-101/local-network) for more information.

    - If the version of Linux you use doesn't support **libpq-dev**, find an equivalent package for it on the [ROS Index](https://index.ros.org/d/libpq-dev/).

- [x] Download and install **build-essential**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

You can install all of the prerequisites for Linux at once using the following command:

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows" value="windows">

- [x] Download and install [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) before downloading Rust.

- [x] Download and install Rust: If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

    - If you have Rust installed, update to the latest version: `rustup update stable`

- [x] Download and install Cargo: Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/)

- [x] Windows 11 ships with a Microsoft version of [cURL](https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html) already installed; however, if you are using Windows 10 or want to use the cURL project version instead, download and install it from [https://curl.se/windows/](https://curl.se/windows/).

- [x] Download and install the [Git command line interface](https://git-scm.com/download/).

- [x] Download and install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

- [x] Download [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) (`protoc-xx.x-win32.zip` or `protoc-xx.x-win64.zip`) and add the `\bin` directory to your Windows `PATH` environment variable.

- [x] For Windows on ARM64 only: Download and install [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).

- [x] Download and install the [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://releases.llvm.org/). Look for a file with a name similar to `LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe` for 64-bit Windows, or `LLVM-15.0.7-win32.exe` for 32-bit Windows.
