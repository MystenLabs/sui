## Build from source

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

To install Sui from source, you first need to install its [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system. After installing the supporting technologies, you can install [Sui binaries from source](#install-sui-binaries-from-source).

You can also download the [source code](/references/contribute/sui-environment.mdx) to have local access to files.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

#### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```sh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```sh
$ rustup update stable
```
#### Additional prerequisites by operating system

:::info

The Linux instructions assume a distribution that uses the APT package manager. You might need to adjust the instructions to use other package managers.

Install the prerequisites listed in this section. Use the following command to update `apt-get`:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
```
