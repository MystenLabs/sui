You can install Sui from source, either locally or directly from GitHub. At minimum, you will need Rust and Cargo installed for the Sui framework: 

- [x] Download and install Rust: 
  <div className="pl-8">
    ```sh
    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    If you have Rust installed, update to the latest version: 
  
    ```sh
    $ rustup update stable
    ```
  </div>
- [x] Download and install Cargo:
  <div className="pl-8">
    ```sh
    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```
  </div>
  
  Depending on your operating system, you may require additional prerequisites.

You can install from source either directly from GitHub or from your local drive. Regardless of which install from source method you use, the Sui components are found in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

You can also download the [source code](/references/contribute/sui-environment) to locally access files.

Use Cargo to install Sui directly from the GitHub repo: 

```sh
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui --features tracing
```

:::info

The tracing feature enables Move test coverage and debugger support in the Sui CLI. These features are not available unless you enable tracing.

:::

Replace the `testnet` branch in the previous command if necessary. Available options are:

    - `main`: Latest updates. Least stable.
    - `devnet`: Includes experimental features.
    - `testnet`: Includes beta features.
    - `mainnet`: Stable release.

You can build and install additional packages as needed. Replace `sui` in the previous command with the package name in the following table.
