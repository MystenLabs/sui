If you have followed the Getting Started path, you should be ready to continue your journey on Sui. To make sure you have everything you need, paste the following commands into a console on your operating system. 

```sh
$ sui --version
$ sui client active-address
$ sui client active-env
$ sui client gas
```

If all commands are successful, your console displays output similar to the following:

```sh
sui [version_number]-[commit_hash]
0x6543...7241
testnet
╭───────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────╮
│ gasCoinId     │ mistBalance (MIST) │ suiBalance (SUI) │
├───────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 0x1e86...63b2 │ 5041161576         │ 5.04             │
╰───────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────╯
```

If you receive an error, revisit the content relevant to the command that caused the error or lacked output.

| Command | Successful if |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `sui --version` | You [installed Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx) correctly. |
| `sui client active-address` | You have a [Sui address](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address.mdx) that is currently active. |
| `sui client active-env` | You have set up a [connection to Testnet](/guides/developer/getting-started/connect.mdx) that is currently active. |
| `sui client objects` | You address owns [SUI for testing](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx). |
