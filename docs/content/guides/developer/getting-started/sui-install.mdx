# Install Sui

Sui is a scalable and performant layer-1 blockchain that is home to a complete stack of native primitives ideal for building decentralized applications. Such primitives, such as those for encryption, data storage, verification, and access control, provide developers with every piece of the application stack without needing to use layer-2 chains or off-chain solutions. 

In contrast to other chains, Sui uses an object-centric model, where every item on the network is an object. Objects are used as input for transactions, which in turn mutate an existing object or create new objects. Each object is addressable on-chain by a unique ID.

To create objects, submit transactions, and start building an application on Sui, first you must install Sui. This installation includes the Sui CLI, a tool used to create and manage address balances, build and deploy smart contracts, and query information from the network.

## Quick install 

The most effective way to install the Sui CLI is to use `suiup`, as it allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of not only the Sui CLI but also other Sui stack components like `walrus` and `mvr`. 

Alternative quick install instructions for Homebrew or Chocolately do not support installing other Sui stack components. Other components will need to be installed through their individual binaries if you'd like to use them in the future.

:::note

The quick install is suitable for most use cases. For those wanting more control over the installation process, you can [install from source](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source) or [install binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries). 

:::

If Sui is already installed from a previous development environment, be sure to upgrade to the [latest version](/guides/developer/getting-started/upgrade-sui).

### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal or console
2. Type `sui --version` and press Enter
3. Verify the displayed version matches your expected installation

If you receive a "command not found" error, verify the Sui binaries directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Installation details 

Regardless of using `suiup`, Brew, or Chocolately, your Sui installation will include the following packages:

### `suiup` installation details 

On macOS and Linux systems, the `suiup` binaries are copied to `$HOME/.local/bin` by default, unless the `SUIUP_DEFAULT_BIN_DIR` environment variable has been set. macOS and Linux installations also include environment variables for `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

On Windows, the `suiup` binaries are copied to `LOCALAPPDATA\bin`, and will use `LOCALAPPDATA` or `USERPROFILE\AppData\Local` for storing data and `TEMP` or `USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Temp` for caching.

### Default configuration file

Regardless of whether you used `suiup`, Homebrew, or Chocolately, Sui will store a primary configuration in the `~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml` file. This file is used to define settings and preferences for your environment, such as:

- Network environment details for the Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Localnet networks.

- Active environment, which specifies which network the CLI commands will target.

- Active address, which specifies which Sui address will be used by the CLI for transactions and queries.

- Keystore location, which specifies where your address' private keys are stored.

## Looking for a project to clone? 

Before you can create and deploy a smart contract, you must [configure your Sui client] and [obtain testnet SUI]

Then, you can [deploy Hello, world!] or [clone another example] to start building.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

Now that you have Sui installed, you must [configure your Sui client].
