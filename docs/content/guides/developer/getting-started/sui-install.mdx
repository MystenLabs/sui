# Install Sui

Sui is a scalable and performant layer-1 blockchain that is home to a complete stack of native primitives ideal for building decentralized applications. Such primitives, such as those for encryption, data storage, verification, and access control, provide developers with every piece of the application stack without needing to use layer-2 chains or off-chain solutions. 

In contrast to other chains, Sui uses an object-centric model, where every item on the network is an object. Objects are used as input for transactions, which in turn mutate an existing object or create new objects. Each object is addressable on-chain by a unique ID.

To start building an application on Sui, first you must install Sui. This installation includes the Sui CLI, a tool used to create and manage address balances, build and deploy smart contracts, and query information from the network. 

### Prerequisites 

- [x] Have a machine with one of the following supported operating systems:
    - Linux: Ubuntu version 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) or newer
    - macOS: macOS Monterey or newer
    - Microsoft Windows: Windows 10 and 11

- [x] 

## Quick install 

The most effective way to install the Sui CLI is to use `suiup`, as it allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of not only the Sui CLI but also other Sui stack components like `walrus` and `mvr`. 

Alternative quick install instructions for Homebrew or Chocolately do not support installing other Sui stack components. Other components will need to be installed through their individual binaries if you'd like to use them in the future.

:::note

The quick install is suitable for most use cases. For those wanting more control over the installation process, you can [install from source](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source) or [install binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries).

#### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal or console
2. Type `sui --version` and press Enter
3. Verify the displayed version matches your expected installation

If you receive a "command not found" error, verify the Sui binaries directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Installing Sui developer tools

If you use VSCode, you can install the [Move extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move) to get language server support for Move, as well as support for building, testing, and debugging Move code within the IDE.
You can install the extension either by searching the fully-qualified extension name, `Mysten.move`, in the extension view, or by pressing `Ctrl-P` or `Cmd-P` and typing `ext install mysten.move`.
Installing the Move extension also installs the appropriate `move-analyzer` binary for your operating system, as well as the [Move Trace Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move-trace-debug) extension, and [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax) extension.

Community-supported Move packages are available for these editors:

- [Emacs](https://github.com/amnn/move-mode)
- [Vim](https://github.com/yanganto/move.vim)
- [Zed](https://github.com/Tzal3x/move-zed-extension)

## Next steps {#next-steps}

Now that you have Sui installed:

- Explore the [Sui CLI reference](/references/cli.mdx) to learn command line operations.
- [Connect to a network](./connect.mdx) to interact with the Sui ecosystem.
- [Acquire test coins](./get-coins.mdx) for development purposes.
- [Build your first dApp](../first-app.mdx) using Sui's programmable transaction model.

    - Sets the stage for what the user is about to install and why they care about installing it.
- Prerequisites
    - Checklist of all prerequisites needed before installing Sui
        - Include download links or commands to install, limit the number of browser tabs a user has to open to get all necessary components.
        - Consider including commands to check if each prerequisite is installed.
            - This might be too text-heavy, weâ€™ll have to see how it formats on the page IMO.
- Quick install instructions
    - Provide Suiup as the default tab/option.
        - Explain what makes Suiup different from brew/choco install.
        - Provide brew/choco install as alternatives and provide context as to why these are different from Suiup
        - Install from binary/from source instructions as children pages, keep those instructions the same as they are now.
        - Add Upgrade Sui page as a child page
    - Details about what installation actually does
        - What actually gets installed?
        - Where are files stored?
        - What environment variables does installation create?
