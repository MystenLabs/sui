# Install Sui

Sui is a scalable and performant layer-1 blockchain that is home to a complete stack of native primitives ideal for building decentralized applications. Such primitives, such as those for [encryption](https://seal-docs.wal.app/UsingSeal/), [data storage](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html), verification, and access control, provide developers with every piece of the application stack without needing to use layer-2 chains or off-chain solutions. 

In contrast to other chains, Sui uses an [object-centric model](/concepts/object-model.mdx), where every item on the network is an object. [Transactions](/concepts/transactions.mdx) use objects as input, which mutate an existing object or create new objects. Each object has a unique on-chain ID.

To create objects, submit transactions, and start building an application on Sui, first you must install Sui. This installation includes the [Sui CLI](/references/cli.mdx), a tool that creates and manages address balances, builds and publishes smart contracts, and queries information from the network.

## Quick install 

The Sui CLI is used to interact with the Sui network, deploy packages, and manage assets. To install the Sui CLI, you can use [`suiup`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

[`suiup`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup) is the most effective installation method, as it allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of not only the Sui CLI but also other Sui stack components like [`walrus`](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html) and [`mvr`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mvr). 

Alternative quick install instructions for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) do not support installing other Sui stack components. Other components will need to be installed through their individual binaries if you'd like to use them in the future. 

:::caution 

Installations using Homebrew or Chocolatey might take several minutes if you do not have any of the [Sui prerequisites](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source) installed. Using `suiup` is often much faster and highly recommended.

<ImportContent source="quick-install.mdx" mode="snippet" />

The quick install is suitable for most use cases. For those wanting more control over the installation process, you can [install from source](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-source.mdx) or [install binaries](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx). 

If Sui is already installed from a previous development environment, be sure to upgrade to the [latest version](/guides/developer/getting-started/install-binaries.mdx).

:::info Looking for a project to clone?

Before you can create and publish a smart contract, you must [configure a Sui client](/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client.mdx) and [obtain SUI tokens](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins.mdx).

Then, you can [create a "Hello, World!" example](/guides/developer/getting-started/hello-world.mdx) or [clone another example](/guides/developer/app-examples.mdx) to start building.

## Installation details 

Regardless of using `suiup`, Homebrew, or Chocolately, your Sui installation will include the following packages:

<ImportContent source="lists/binaries-file-list.mdx" mode="snippet" />

### `suiup` installation details 

`suiup` copies the binaries to `$HOME/.local/bi`n by default on macOS and Linux systems by default, unless the `SUIUP_DEFAULT_BIN_DIR` environment variable has been set. macOS and Linux installations also include environment variables for `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

On Windows, `suiup` copies the binaries to `LOCALAPPDATA\bin`, and will use `LOCALAPPDATA` or `USERPROFILE\AppData\Local` for storing data and `TEMP` or `USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Temp` for caching.

### Default configuration file

Regardless of whether you used `suiup`, Homebrew, or Chocolately, Sui will store a primary configuration in the `~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml` file. This file defines settings and preferences for your environment, such as:

- Network environment details for Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Localnet networks.

- Active environment, which specifies the network the CLI commands will target.

- Active address, which specifies the Sui address the CLI will use for transactions and queries.

- Keystore location, which specifies where Sui stores your address' private keys.
