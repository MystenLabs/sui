The quickest way to install Sui is using the binaries delivered with every release. If you require more control over the install process, you can install from source. To take advantage of containerization, you can utilize the Docker images in the `docker` folder of the sui repository.

## Supported operating systems {#supported-operating-systems}

Sui supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver)
- macOS - macOS Monterey
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 10 and 11

## Install using Homebrew {#install-homebrew}

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install Sui with the following command:

```bash
brew install sui
```

## Install from binaries {#install-binaries}

Each Sui release provides a set of binaries for several operating systems. You can download these binaries from GitHub and use them to install Sui.

1. Go to https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.
1. In the right pane, find the **Releases** section.

    ![Sui releases in GitHub](./images/releases.png)
1. Click the release tagged **Latest** to open the release's page.
1. In the **Assets** section of the release, select the .tgz compressed file that corresponds to your operating system.
1. Double-click the downloaded file. If the file doesn't automatically expand, manually unzip the file.
1. Open the expanded folder and double-click the appropriate binary to install, beginning with sui-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`:

    - sui-faucet-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Local faucet to mint coins on local network.
    - sui-indexer-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: An indexer for a local Sui network.
    - sui-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Main Sui binary.
    - sui-node-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Run a local node.
    - sui-test-validator-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Run test validators on a local network for development.
    - sui-tool-`<OS>`-`<ARCHITECTURE>`: Provides utilities for Sui.

    The Sui binary takes several minutes to download and install files, so make sure you allocate enough time for it to complete. Actual time to complete depends on your network connection and computer specifications.


### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly, type `sui` and press Enter. You should see a message about the Sui version installed and help for using Sui commands.

## Install from source

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

To install Sui from source, you first need to install its [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system. After installing the supporting technologies, you can install [Sui binaries from source](#install-sui-binaries-from-source).

You can also download the [source code](./sui-environment) to have local access to files.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

## Install Sui binaries from source {#install-sui-binaries-from-source}

Run the following command to install Sui binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

The install process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

The command installs Sui components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade Sui binaries

If you previously installed the Sui binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you used to install them:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

## Next steps {#next-steps}

Now that you have Sui installed, it's time to start developing. Check out the following topics to start working with Sui:

- Read about the [Sui CLI](/references/cli.mdx), the most straightforward way to start exploring Sui networks.
- [Learn about the available networks](./connect.mdx) and connect to one.
- [Get some coins](./get-coins.mdx) on a development network.
- [Build your first dApp](../first-app.mdx) to start your on-chain journey.
