title: Install Sui
description: Install the Sui framework and required prerequisites on your system, including the Sui command line interface to interact with the Sui network.
---

The quickest way to install Sui is using the binaries delivered with every release. If you require more control over the install process, you can install from source. To take advantage of containerization, you can utilize the Docker images in the `docker` folder of the sui repository.

## Supported operating systems {#supported-operating-systems}

Sui supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver) or later
- macOS - macOS Monterey or later
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 10 and 11

## Quick install using Homebrew or Chocolatey {#install-homebrew}

{@include: ../../../snippets/quick-install.mdx}

:::info

If you use this method to install Sui, you are all set. The quick install is suitable for most use cases. The remaining installation methods are for those wanting more control over the installation process.

## Download binaries from GitHub {#install-binaries}

Each Sui release provides a set of binaries for several operating systems. You can download these binaries from GitHub and use them to install Sui.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
1. Go to https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.
1. In the right pane, find the **Releases** section.

    ![Sui releases in GitHub](./images/releases.png)
1. Click the release tagged **Latest** to open the release's page.
1. In the **Assets** section of the release, select the .tgz compressed file that corresponds to your operating system.
1. Extract all files from the .tgz file into the preferred location on your system. These instructions assume you extract the files into a `sui` folder at the user root of your system for demonstration purposes. Replace references to this location in subsequent steps if you choose a different directory.
1. Navigate to the expanded folder. You should have the following extracted files:

    {@include: ../../../snippets/binaries-file-list.mdx}

1. Add the folder containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. To do so, you can update your `~/.bashrc` to include the location of the Sui binaries. If using the suggested location, you type `export PATH=$PATH:~/sui` and press Enter.
1. Start a new terminal session or type `source ~/.bashrc` to load the new `PATH` value.

1. Start a new terminal session or type `source ~/.zshrc` (or `.bashrc`) to load the new `PATH` value.
1. If running the binaries for the first time, you might receive an error from MacOS that prevents the binaries from running. If you receive this error, close the dialog and type `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/sui/*` in your terminal and press Enter (be sure to adjust the path if different).

<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

1. Go to https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.
1. In the right pane, find the **Releases** section.

    ![Sui releases in GitHub](./images/releases.png)

    :::info 

    Windows does not natively support .tgz files, but you can use a free compressed file app like [7Zip](https://7-zip.org/) to extract.

    :::

1. Navigate to the expanded folder. You should have the following extracted files:

    {@include: ../../../snippets/binaries-file-list.mdx}

1. Add the folder containing the extracted files to your `PATH` variable. There are several ways to get to the setting depending on your version of Windows. One way that works on all versions of Windows is to type `sysdm.cpl` in a console to open the System Properties window. Under the **Advanced** tab, click the **Environment Variables...** button.
1. In the Environment Variables window, select the `Path` variable and click the **Edit...** button. 
1. In the Edit environment variable window, click **New** and add the path to your expanded folder. Using the example path, this would be `C:\sui`.
1. Click **OK**.

:::info 

Running binaries other than `sui` might require installing prerequisites itemized in the following section. 

:::

#### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly, type `sui --version` in your console or terminal and press Enter. The response should provide the Sui version installed. If the console or terminal responds with a command not found error, make sure the full path to your Sui binaries is included in your `PATH` variable.

## Install from Cargo {#install-sui-binaries-from-source}

Run the following command to install Sui binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

The install process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

The command installs Sui components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade from Cargo

If you previously installed the Sui binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you used to install them (changing `testnet` to the desired branch):

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

## Build from source

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

To install Sui from source, you first need to install its [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system. After installing the supporting technologies, you can install [Sui binaries from source](#install-sui-binaries-from-source).

You can also download the [source code](/references/contribute/sui-environment.mdx) to have local access to files.

#### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

#### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```
