Unlike the CLI option used in [Obtain a Sui Address](/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address), wallets connected to the Sui network provide visual workflows that might be preferable to some users. 

The following Chrome extension wallets integrate with your browser and have a UI workflow that walks you through the process of creating an address. Consult documentation for your chosen extension for the exact process of obtaining an address.
