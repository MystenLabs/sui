## Upgrade from Cargo

If you previously installed the Sui binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you used to install them (changing `testnet` to the desired branch):

```sh
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui --features tracing
```

:::info
The `tracing` feature enables Move test coverage and debugger support in the Sui CLI. These features are not available unless you enable tracing.
