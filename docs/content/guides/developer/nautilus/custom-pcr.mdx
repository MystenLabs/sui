Sui supports custom Platform Configuration Register (PCR) verification. PCR verification is used by AWS Nitro Enclaves to confirm that code running in an isolated environment is authentic and unmodified. Nautilus uses custom PCR verification to provide a form of verifiable confidential compute without trust assumptions and enable use cases where confidential apps can prove their code running in a trusted execution environment (TEE) is secure and has not been tampered with.

## What is Marlin Oyster?

Marlin Oyster integrates with the Nautilus framework to remove the operational overhead of managing enclave infrastructure while preserving cryptographic guarantees and transforming TEE access into a decentralized marketplace. By using Marlin Oyster, you no longer have to manage cloud accounts, enclave images, attestation servers, or networking configurations.

You can learn more about Marlin Oyster and Nautilus on the [Marlin blog](https://blog.marlin.org/scaling-confidential-compute-on-sui-nautilus-and-marlin-oyster-integration), or learn more about Marlin on the [Marlin documentation](https://docs.marlin.org/oyster/introduction-to-marlin/).

## How it works

Marlin Oyster uses the following workflow:

1. Developers build an application and package it into a Docker image.

1. To run the application, the Docker image is deployed as a job on the Oyster marketplace. Developers pay for the job with stablecoin.

1. Oyster operators claim the job submission, provision a Nitro Enclave, and run the application's workload. Oyster operators cannot alter an application's logic.

1. The enclave generates a PCR measurement that acts as a cryptographic verification of the application's code. A Sui Move contract can verify this PCR measurement on-chain.

This workflow provides the same cryptographic guarantees as a self-managed Nautilus deployment.

## Example

You can use the [Sui Oyster demo application](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/sui-oyster-demo) as a reference implementation to begin building. This example application creates and deploys a decentralized price oracle using Oyster enclaves. In the example, data is fetched securely, signed with a Nitro Enclave, and verified with signatures on-chain using PCR attestation.
