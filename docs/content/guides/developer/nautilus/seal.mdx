The Seal-Nautilus pattern provides secure secret management for enclave applications, where you can encrypt any secrets for an enclave binary.

You can define a Seal policy configured with specified Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) of the enclave. Then, encrypt data using Seal with a fixed ID. Only the enclave with the given PCRs can decrypt it.

## Components

The following example that demonstrates the Seal-Nautilus pattern uses the following components:

1. Nautilus server running inside AWS Nitro Enclave (`src/nautilus-server/src/apps/seal-example`): This is the only place that the Seal secret can be decrypted according to the policy. It exposes port 3000 to the internet with the `/get_attestation` and `/process_data` endpoints. It also exposes port 3001 to the localhost with 3 `/admin` endpoints that can only be used to initialize and complete the key load steps on the host instance where the enclave runs.

1. Seal [CLI](https://github.com/MystenLabs/seal/tree/main/crates/seal-cli): In particular, [`encrypt` and `fetch-keys`](https://seal-docs.wal.app/SealCLI/#7-encrypt-and-fetch-keys-using-service-providers) are used for this example.

1. Move contract `move/seal-policy/seal_policy.move`: Defines the `seal_approve` policy that verifies the signature committed to the wallet public key using the enclave ephemeral key.

## Phase 1: Start and register the server

:::info

Admin in this context refers to someone who has access to the EC2 instance. The admin can build and run the enclave binary on it and call the admin-only enclave endpoints through localhost on the EC2 instance.

:::

1. The admin specifies the `seal_config.yaml` with the published Seal policy package ID and Seal configurations.

<ImportContent source="src/nautilus-server/src/apps/seal-example/seal_config.yaml" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="Nautilus" />

The admin builds and runs the enclave with the exposed `/get_attestation` endpoint.

<summary>`src/nautilus-server/src/apps/seal-example/endpoints.rs`</summary>

<ImportContent source="src/nautilus-server/src/apps/seal-example/endpoints.rs" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="Nautilus" />

</details>

1. The admin uses the attestation response to register PCRs and the enclave public key. The `/process_data` endpoint returns an error at this point because the `SEAL_API_KEY` is not yet initialized.

1. The admin registers the enclave on-chain and retrieves the enclave object ID and initial shared version.

## Phease 2: Initialize and complete key load

1. The admin calls `/admin/init_seal_key_load` with the enclave object. The enclave returns an encoded `FetchKeyRequest`.

1. The admin uses the `FetchKeyRequest` to call the CLI and get Seal responses that are encrypted under the enclave's encryption public key.

1. The admin calls `/admin/complete_seal_key_load` with Seal responses. The enclave decrypts and caches all Seal keys in memory for later use.

## Phase 3: Provision application secrets

1. Now that Seal keys are cached, encrypted objects can be decrypted on-demand using the cached keys. For this example, the admin calls `/admin/provision_weather_api_key` with the encrypted weather API key object. The enclave decrypts it using the cached keys and stores it as `SEAL_API_KEY`.

1. The enclave can now serve `/process_data` requests.

## Security guarantees

The enclave generates 3 keys on startup, all kept only in enclave memory:

1. Enclave ephemeral key pair (`state.eph_kp`): Ed25519 key pair. Used to sign `/process_data` responses and to create the signature argument in `seal_approve` PTB. Its public key is registered on-chain in the Enclave object.

1. Seal wallet (`WALLET_BYTES`): Ed25519 key pair. Used for Seal certificate signing and as the transaction sender for `seal_approve`.

1. ElGamal encryption key pair (`ENCRYPTION_KEYS`): BLS group elements. Used to decrypt Seal responses.

During `/init_seal_key_load`, the wallet signs a `PersonalMessage` for the certificate. The enclave also creates a programmable transaction block (PTB) for `seal_approve` where the signature argument is created by the enclave ephemeral key pair signing an intent message containing the wallet's public key and timestamp. When Seal servers dry-run the transaction, `seal_approve` verifies:

1. The signature is verified using the enclave's ephemeral public key (from `enclave.pk()`) and the intent message with scope `WalletPK` over the wallet public key and timestamp.

1. The key ID is a fixed value of `vector[0]`.

1. The transaction sender matches the wallet public key.

This proves that only the enclave, which has access to the wallet and the ephemeral key pair, could have created a valid signed PTB, as the ephemeral key pair commits to the wallet public key.

During `/init_seal_key_load`, the enclave also generates an encryption key pair and returns the encryption public key as part of `FetchKeyRequest`. The fetch key CLI is called outside the enclave, but no one except the enclave can decrypt the `FetchKeyResponse` because only the enclave has the encryption secret key. The `FetchKeyResponse` is then passed to the enclave at `/complete_seal_key_load`, and only the enclave can verify and decrypt the Seal key in memory.

### Why is a 2-step key load needed?

An enclave operates without direct internet access, so it cannot fetch secrets from Seal key servers' HTTP endpoints directly. This example uses the host as an intermediary to fetch encrypted secrets from Seal servers.

This delegation is secure because the Seal responses are encrypted under the enclave's encryption key, so only the enclave can decrypt the fetched Seal responses. The public keys of the Seal servers in `seal_config.yaml` are defined by the admin in the enclave, so the enclave can verify the decrypted Seal key has not been tampered with.

## Example deployment steps

### Step 0: Build, run, and register enclave

```shell
# publish the enclave package
cd move/enclave
sui move build && sui client publish

# find this in output and set env var
ENCLAVE_PACKAGE_ID=0x8ecf22e78c90c3e32833d76d82415d7e4227ea370bec4efdad4c4830cbda9e49

# publish the seal-policy app package
cd ../seal-policy
sui move build && sui client publish

# find these in output and set env vars
CAP_OBJECT_ID=0xbd6ad872040eddc08f20ff11e20a3dc030c3e30f4ab2303a0c42447006724262
ENCLAVE_CONFIG_OBJECT_ID=0x3ee612ffc17f29280b8479c36a1096a339e38c353a7662baa559ba4d879dd4de

# update seal_config.yaml with APP_PACKAGE_ID inside the enclave

# configure ec2 instance for enclave, see main guide for more details: UsingNautilus.md

# ssh in the ec2 instance containing the repo on configured diff: docker build, run and expose
make ENCLAVE_APP=seal-example && make run && sh expose_enclave.sh

# find the pcrs and set env vars
cat out/nitro.pcrs

PCR0=84db3309c8a06c31c1c0a44701fb6c47766244925d7c1d32d5e6589cbdea23aa1f619cddc62c7368ffe648a07df2feb8
PCR1=84db3309c8a06c31c1c0a44701fb6c47766244925d7c1d32d5e6589cbdea23aa1f619cddc62c7368ffe648a07df2feb8
PCR2=21b9efbc184807662e966d34f390821309eeac6802309798826296bf3e8bec7c10edb30948c90ba67310f7b964fc500a

# populate name and url
MODULE_NAME=weather
OTW_NAME=WEATHER
ENCLAVE_URL=http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000

# update pcrs
sui client call --function update_pcrs --module enclave --package $ENCLAVE_PACKAGE_ID --type-args "$APP_PACKAGE_ID::$MODULE_NAME::$OTW_NAME" --args $ENCLAVE_CONFIG_OBJECT_ID $CAP_OBJECT_ID 0x$PCR0 0x$PCR1 0x$PCR2

# optional, update name
sui client call --function update_name --module enclave --package $ENCLAVE_PACKAGE_ID --type-args "$APP_PACKAGE_ID::$MODULE_NAME::$OTW_NAME" --args $ENCLAVE_CONFIG_OBJECT_ID $CAP_OBJECT_ID "some name here"

# register the enclave onchain 
sh register_enclave.sh $ENCLAVE_PACKAGE_ID $APP_PACKAGE_ID $ENCLAVE_CONFIG_OBJECT_ID $ENCLAVE_URL $MODULE_NAME $OTW_NAME

# read from output the created enclave obj id and finds its initial shared version 
ENCLAVE_OBJECT_ID=0x9b8bc44069abc9843bbd2f54b4e7732136cc7c615c34959f98ab2f7c74f002bd
ENCLAVE_OBJ_VERSION=722158400
```

At this point, the enclave is running but has no `SEAL_API_KEY` and cannot process requests.
```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"payload": { "location": "San Francisco"}}' -X POST http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/process_data

{"error":"API key not initialized. Please complete key load first."}%
```

### Step 1: Encrypt secret

You can run the Seal CLI command from the root directory of the [Seal repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/seal). Perform this step anywhere the secret value is secure. The output is used later in Step 4.

This command looks up the public keys of the specified key servers ID using a public full node on the given network. Then it uses the identity `id`, threshold `t`, the specified key servers `-k`, and the policy package `-p` to encrypt the secret.
```bash
# in seal repo
# set package id from step 0
APP_PACKAGE_ID=0x2080f9c370ddb22c48d6377f8aa64883c3a1c61d3febbcc18b6bf70553ae45a0
cargo run --bin seal-cli encrypt --secret 303435613237383132646265343536333932393133323233323231333036 \
    --id 0x00 \
    -p $APP_PACKAGE_ID \
    -t 2 \
    -k 0x73d05d62c18d9374e3ea529e8e0ed6161da1a141a94d3f76ae3fe4e99356db75,0xf5d14a81a982144ae441cd7d64b09027f116a468bd36e7eca494f750591623c8 \
    -n testnet

Encrypted object:
<ENCRYPTED_OBJECT>
```

`--secret`: The secret value you are encrypting in hexadecimal format. Only the enclave can decrypt it. This example uses the value `weather-api-key` converted from UTF-8 to hexadecimal:
```python
>>> '045a27812dbe456392913223221306'.encode('utf-8').hex()
'303435613237383132646265343536333932393133323233323231333036'
```

`--id`: A fixed value of 0x00. This is the identity used to encrypt any data to the enclave.
`-p`: The package ID containing the Seal policy.
`-k`: A list of key server object IDs. Use the 2 Mysten open Testnet servers.
`-t`: Threshold used for encryption.
`-n`: The network of the key servers you are using.

### Step 2: Initialize key load

Perform this step on the host where the enclave runs, which can communicate with the enclave through port 3001.

In this call, the enclave creates a certificate signed by the wallet and constructs a PTB calling `seal_approve`. The enclave ephemeral key pair signs an intent message of the wallet public key. A session key signs the request and returns the encoded `FetchKeyRequest`.
```bash
# use ENCLAVE_OBJECT_ID and ENCLAVE_OBJ_VERSION from step 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/init_seal_key_load \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"enclave_object_id": "'$ENCLAVE_OBJECT_ID'", "initial_shared_version": '$ENCLAVE_OBJ_VERSION'}'

# Expected response:
{"encoded_request":"<FETCH_KEY_REQUEST>"}
```

### Step 3: Fetch keys from Seal servers

From the root of the Seal repo, run the command:
```bash
# in seal repo
cargo run --bin seal-cli fetch-keys --request <FETCH_KEY_REQUEST> \
    -k 0x73d05d62c18d9374e3ea529e8e0ed6161da1a141a94d3f76ae3fe4e99356db75,0xf5d14a81a982144ae441cd7d64b09027f116a468bd36e7eca494f750591623c8 \
    -t 2 \
    -n testnet

Encoded seal responses:
<ENCODED_SEAL_RESPONSES>
```

`--request`: Output of Step 2.
`-k`: A list of key server object IDs. Use the 2 Mysten open Testnet servers.
`-t`: Threshold used for encryption.
`-n`: The network of the key servers you are using.

This command parses the hexadecimal encoded BCS serialized `FetchKeyRequest` and fetches keys from the specified key server objects for the given network. Each key server verifies the PTB and signature, then returns encrypted key shares encrypted to the enclave's ephemeral ElGamal key if the Seal policy is satisfied. The CLI gathers all responses and returns a hexadecimal encoded value containing a list of Seal object IDs and their server responses.

### Step 4: Complete key load

Perform this step on the host where the enclave runs, which can communicate with the enclave through port 3001. If it returns `OK`, the enclave decrypts and caches the Seal keys in memory. Replace `<ENCODED_SEAL_RESPONSES>` with the output from Step 3.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/complete_seal_key_load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "seal_responses": "<ENCODED_SEAL_RESPONSES>"
  }'

# Expected response:
{"status":"OK"}
```

### Step 5: Provision weather API key

Perform this step on the host where the enclave runs, which can communicate with the enclave through port 3001. Replace `<ENCRYPTED_OBJECT>` with the output from Step 1.

In this call, the enclave uses the cached keys from Step 4 to decrypt the encrypted weather API key. This endpoint is application-specific; replace or add more endpoints as needed. Repeat Step 1 to encrypt other data using ID value 0 and provision them to the enclave with an endpoint.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/provision_weather_api_key \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "encrypted_object": "<ENCRYPTED_OBJECT>"
  }'

# Expected response:
{"status":"OK"}
```

### Step 6: Use the service

The enclave server is now fully functional and can process data.
```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"payload": { "location": "San Francisco"}}' -X POST http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3000/process_data

# Example response: 
{"response":{"intent":0,"timestamp_ms":1755805500000,"data":{"location":"San Francisco","temperature":18}},"signature":"4587c11eafe8e78c766c745c9f89b3bb7fd1a914d6381921e8d7d9822ddc9556966932df1c037e23bedc21f369f6edc66c1b8af019778eb6b1ec1ee7f324e801"}
```

## Handle multiple secrets

Because Seal uses public key encryption, you can encrypt many secrets using the same fixed ID value of 0. Repeat Step 1 with any data, using the same package ID and the same ID value of 0.

Run Steps 2–4 once to cache the Seal keys for the enclave.

Once keys are cached, decrypt any encrypted object by implementing one or more provision endpoints similar to Step 5.

## Multiple enclaves

Multiple enclaves can access the same Seal encrypted secret. An alternative is to use one enclave to provision to other attested enclaves directly, without needing to fetch keys from Seal.

## Troubleshooting

1. Certificate expired error in Step 3: The certificate in the `FetchKeyRequest` expires after 30 minutes (TTL). Re-run Step 2 to generate a fresh request with a new certificate, then retry Step 3.

1. Enclave restarts: If the enclave restarts, all ephemeral keys (including cached Seal keys) are lost. You must re-run Steps 2–5 to reinitialize the enclave with secrets.
