title: Party Objects
description: Party objects are owned by a specified party at the time of transfer and versioned by consensus. Learn how to create and access these objects.
---

A party object combines properties of both address-owned objects and shared objects. Like address-owned objects, party objects can be owned by a single address. Like shared objects, they are versioned by consensus. Unlike shared objects, they can be transferred to and from other ownership types and wrapped.

Party objects are transferred using the [`sui::transfer::party_transfer`](/references/framework/sui_sui/transfer#sui_transfer_party_transfer) or [`sui::transfer::public_party_transfer`](/references/framework/sui_sui/transfer#sui_transfer_public_party_transfer) function. It is accessible to the `Party` to which it is transferred.

Only single ownership is supported for party objects.

## Create party objects

Use these [`transfer` module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/transfer.move) functions to create party objects:

```
public fun party_transfer<T: key>(obj: T, party: sui::party::Party)
public fun public_party_transfer<T: key + store>(obj: T, party: sui::party::Party)
```

- Use the [`sui::transfer::party_transfer`](/references/framework/sui_sui/transfer#sui_transfer_party_transfer) function if you are defining a [custom transfer policy](/guides/developer/objects/transfers/custom-rules.mdx) for the object. 

- Use the [`sui::transfer::public_party_transfer`](/references/framework/sui_sui/transfer#sui_transfer_public_party_transfer) function if the object has the `store` capability.

A party object's ownership can change over its lifetime, either by adding it as a [dynamic object field](/concepts/dynamic-fields.mdx), transferring it to a different address or ownership type, or making it [immutable](/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership/immutable.mdx). However, after you create an object and set its ownership, it cannot be [shared](/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership/shared.mdx).

## When to use party objects

Use party objects when you want an object to be versioned by [consensus](/concepts/sui-architecture/consensus.mdx), such as for operational convenience. If an object is only used with other party or [shared](/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership/shared.mdx) objects, converting it to a party object has no additional performance cost.

Party objects can be used by multiple inflight [transactions](/concepts/transactions.mdx) at the same time. This contrasts with [address-owned](/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership/address-owned.mdx) objects, which only allow a single inflight transaction. Many applications can benefit from the ability to pipeline multiple transactions on the same party object.

:::info

`Coin`s can be party objects, including `Coin<SUI>`. However, you cannot use a party object `Coin<SUI>` for gas payment. To use a party object `Coin<SUI>` for gas, you must first transfer it back to address-owned.

## Interact with party objects

You can specify party objects as input to a transaction in the same way as shared objects. Sui validators ensure that the sender of the transaction can access the object. The validator might abort a transaction at execution time if the owner of an input party object has changed because of an earlier, conflicting transaction.

Party objects whose owning address corresponds to an object ID are not supported for access through the [transfer to object](/guides/developer/objects/transfers/transfer-to-object.mdx) mechanism. To transfer a party object owned by an account address:
