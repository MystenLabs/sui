If you need a near real-time measurement (within a few seconds) for your application, use the immutable reference of time provided by the `Clock` module in Move. The reference value from this module updates with every network checkpoint. If you do not need the current time, use the `epoch_timestamp_ms` function to refer to the timestamp of when the current epoch started.

## The `sui::clock::Clock` module

To access the current timestamp, you must pass a read-only reference of `sui::clock::Clock` as an entry function parameter in your transactions. Sui provides an instance of `Clock` at address `0x6`. You cannot create new instances.

Use the `timestamp_ms` function from the `sui::clock` module to extract a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.

The example below demonstrates an entry function that emits an event containing a timestamp from `sui::clock::Clock`:

<ImportContent source="examples/move/basics/sources/clock.move" mode="code" noComments />

Call the previous entry function with the following format, passing `0x6` as the address for the `Clock` parameter:

<ImportContent source="info-gas-budget.mdx" mode="snippet" />

```sh
$ sui client call --package <EXAMPLE> --module 'clock' --function 'access' --args '0x6' --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

The `sui::clock::Clock` timestamp changes at the rate the network generates checkpoints, which is approximately every 1/4 second. Find the current network checkpoint rate on the [public dashboard](https://metrics.sui.io/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

Successful calls to `sui::clock::timestamp_ms` in the same transaction always produce the same result because transactions take effect instantly, but timestamps from `sui::clock::Clock` are otherwise monotonic across transactions that touch the same shared objects. Successful transactions see a greater or equal timestamp to their predecessors.

Any transaction that requires access to `sui::clock::Clock` must go through consensus because the only available instance is a shared object. As a result, this technique is not suitable for transactions that must use the single-owner fastpath. See [Epoch timestamps](#epoch-timestamps) for a single-owner-compatible source of timestamps.

Transactions that use this workflow must accept it as an immutable reference, not a mutable reference or value. This prevents contention, as transactions that access `sui::clock::Clock` can only read it, so they do not need to be sequenced relative to each other. Validators refuse to sign transactions that do not meet this requirement. Packages that include entry functions that accept `sui::clock::Clock` or `&mut Clock` fail to publish.

The following functions test `sui::clock::Clock`-dependent code by manually creating a `Clock` object and manipulating its timestamp. This is only possible in test code:

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/clock.move" mode="code" fun="create_for_testing,share_for_testing,increment_for_testing,set_for_testing,destroy_for_testing" noComments />

The next example presents a basic test that creates a `Clock` object, increments it, and then checks its value:

## Epoch timestamps

Use the following function from the `sui::tx_context` module to access the timestamp for the start of the current epoch for all transactions, including ones that do not go through consensus:

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/tx_context.move" mode="code" fun="epoch_timestamp_ms" noComments />

This function returns the point in time when the current epoch started as a millisecond granularityUunix timestamp in a `u64`. This value changes roughly once every 24 hours when the epoch changes.

Tests based on `sui::test_scenario` can use `later_epoch` to exercise time-sensitive code that uses `epoch_timestamp_ms:

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/test/test_scenario.move" mode="code" fun="later_epoch" noComments />

`later_epoch` behaves like `sui::test_scenario::next_epoch` as it finishes the current transaction and epoch in the test scenario, but also increments the timestamp by `delta_ms` milliseconds to simulate the progress of time.
