In many education systems, 101-level classes are those that teach core competencies to build a foundation for the more advanced topics that are to come. The topics in this section provide the same experience for the Sui blockchain. They examine the core Sui development concepts that you use to build apps on Sui. As you start developing more advanced solutions, knowledge of these topics provides a good base for understanding the more advanced concepts you will employ.

## Working with PTBs

You can create programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) on Sui to perform multiple commands in a single transaction. The Working with PTBs topics demonstrate how to build efficient PTBs using the Sui TypeScript SDK.

Go to [Working with PTBs](./sui-101/working-with-ptbs.mdx).

## Using events

You can emit events from your published packages on the Sui network. Using Events demonstrates how to emit events from your on-chain packages and monitor the activity of other objects emitting events.

Go to [Using Events](./sui-101/using-events.mdx).

## Object Ownership

Object ownership on Sui can be represented in a number of different ways. Object Ownership Basics examines the differences and what considerations to account for when deciding how to structure your on-chain app. 

Go to [Object Ownership Basics](./sui-101/object-ownership.mdx).

## Access on-chain time

Sui provides a `Clock` module you can use to get network-based time. Access On-Chain Time examines the `Clock` module and the behavior of the available methods that affect transaction processing speed and the temporal exactness of the data you receive.

Go to [Access On-Chain Time](./sui-101/access-time.mdx).
