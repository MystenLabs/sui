title: Access On-Chain Time
description: Access network-based time for your transactions. Sui provides a Clock module to capture near-real time or epoch time in your Sui packages.
---

You have options when needing to access network-based time for your transactions. If you need a near real-time measurement (within a few seconds), use the immutable reference of time provided by the `Clock` module in Move. The reference value from this module updates with every network checkpoint. If you don't need as current a time slice, use the `epoch_timestamp_ms` function to capture the precise moment the current epoch started.

## The sui::clock::Clock module

To access a prompt timestamp, you must pass a read-only reference of `sui::clock::Clock` as an entry function parameter in your transactions. An instance of `Clock` is provided at address `0x6`, no new instances can be created.

Use the `timestamp_ms` function from the `sui::clock` module to extract a unix timestamp in milliseconds.

{@inject: crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/clock.move#fun=timestamp_ms noComments}

The example below demonstrates an entry function that emits an event containing a timestamp from the `Clock`:

{@inject: examples/move/basics/sources/clock.move#module=basics::clock noComments}

A call to the previous entry function takes the following form, passing `0x6` as the address for the `Clock` parameter:

{@include: ../../../snippets/info-gas-budget.mdx}

```sh
$ sui client call --package <EXAMPLE> --module 'clock' --function 'access' --args '0x6' --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT>
```

Expect the `Clock` timestamp to change at the rate the network generates checkpoints, which is about **every 1/4 second** with Mysticeti consensus. Find the current network checkpoint rate on this [public dashboard](https://metrics.sui.io/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

Successive calls to `sui::clock::timestamp_ms` in the same transaction always produce the same result (transactions are considered to take effect instantly), but timestamps from `Clock` are otherwise monotonic across transactions that touch the same shared objects: Successive transactions seeing a greater or equal timestamp to their predecessors.

Any transaction that requires access to a `Clock` must go through consensus because the only available instance is a shared object. As a result, this technique is not suitable for transactions that must use the single-owner fastpath (see Epoch timestamps for a single-owner-compatible source of timestamps).

Transactions that use the clock must accept it as an **immutable reference** (not a mutable reference or value). This prevents contention, as transactions that access the `Clock` can only read it, so do not need to be sequenced relative to each other. Validators refuse to sign transactions that do not meet this requirement and packages that include entry functions that accept a `Clock` or `&mut Clock` fail to publish.

The following functions test `Clock`-dependent code by manually creating a `Clock` object and manipulating its timestamp. This is possible only in test code:

{@inject: crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/clock.move#fun=create_for_testing,share_for_testing,increment_for_testing,set_for_testing,destroy_for_testing noComments}

The next example presents a basic test that creates a Clock, increments it, and then checks its value:

{@inject: crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/tests/clock_tests.move#module=sui::clock_tests noComments}

## Epoch timestamps

Use the following function from the `sui::tx_context` module to access the timestamp for the start of the current epoch for all transactions (including ones that do not go through consensus):

{@inject: crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/tx_context.move#fun=epoch_timestamp_ms noComments}

The preceding function returns the point in time when the current epoch started, as a millisecond granularity unix timestamp in a `u64`. This value changes roughly **once every 24 hours**, when the epoch changes.

Tests based on `sui::test_scenario` can use `later_epoch` (following code), to exercise time-sensitive code that uses `epoch_timestamp_ms` (previous code):
{@inject: crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/test/test_scenario.move#fun=later_epoch noComments}

`later_epoch` behaves like `sui::test_scenario::next_epoch` (finishes the current transaction and epoch in the test scenario), but also increments the timestamp by `delta_ms` milliseconds to simulate the progress of time.
