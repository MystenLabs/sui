title: Loyalty Tokens
---

Using the Sui [Closed-Loop Token](../../../../standards/closed-loop-token.mdx) standard, you can create tokens that are valid only for a specific service, like an airline that wants to grant tokens to frequent flyers to purchase tickets or upgrades. 

The following example demonstrates the creation of a loyalty token that bearers can use to make purchases in a digital gift shop. Use the comments in the code to follow the logic of the example.

/// This module illustrates a Closed Loop Loyalty Token. The `Token` is sent to
/// users as a reward for their loyalty by the application Admin. The `Token`
/// can be used to buy a `Gift` in the shop.

    const EIncorrectAmount: u64 = 0;

    /// The OTW for the Token / Coin.
    struct LOYALTY has drop {}

    /// This is the Rule requirement for the `GiftShop`. The Rules don't need
