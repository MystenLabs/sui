Address aliases can be used to configure the set of keys that are allowed to sign transactions for a particular address on the Sui network.

You can use address aliases to:
- Perform simple key rotation for an address.
- Grant multiple signers full access to everything owned by an address.
- Implement more complicated authentication schemes, such as smart wallets with passkeys.

:::warning

All aliases for a given address have the ability to individually sign transactions acting as that address, and to control all resources owned by it. Be extremely careful when making any changes to your aliases.

## How aliases work

Each address on Sui has a set of aliases. New addresses begin as their own alias. That is, a new address `A` has the alias set `{A}`.

You can modify aliases for an address using the Move API in the <UnsafeLink href="/references/framework/sui-framework/sui_sui/address_alias">`sui::address_alias` module</UnsafeLink>. These modification functions must be invoked as top-level PTB commands and cannot be called from other Move functions.

Some constraints for modifying aliases:
* An address must always have at least one alias.
* An address can be removed from its own alias set. For example, one can have an address `A` which only allows signatures from `{B, C}`.
* There is a maximum number of allowed aliases for an address (currently 8).

### Authenticating transactions with aliased addresses

Transactions on Sui are configured with two addresses: a `sender` and a `gas_owner` (which may or may not be the same). For each configured address, a signature is required from one of the signers in its alias set.

For example, with the following transaction and aliases:
```
transaction T {
  sender: A
  gas_owner: X
  ...
}

aliases[A] = {A, B}
aliases[X] = {Y}
```

To be valid, the transaction `T` would require a signature from either `A` or `B`, *and* a signature from `Y`.

The transaction "acts as" its `sender` for the purposes of execution. In the example above, even if the transaction had signatures from `[B, Y]` and not from `A`, during execution it would nonetheless have access to everything owned by `A`, and during Move call execution its `TxContext::sender` would be `A`.
