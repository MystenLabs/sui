Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) are key elements of the Sui ecosystem. Understanding PTBs and using them correctly are key fundamentals to creating efficient and cost-effective smart contracts. See [Programmable Transaction Blocks](../../../concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks.mdx) to learn about the structure of PTBs on Sui.

The topics in this section focus on effectively utilizing PTBs in your smart contracts.
