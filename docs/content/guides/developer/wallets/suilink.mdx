[SuiLink](https://www.suilink.io/) enables securely linking wallet addresses from different blockchains to a Sui wallet address. Upon creating a SuiLink, you receive a soulbound NFT that serves as authenticated proof of ownership for your connected wallets.

## Key features

SuiLink provides the following capabilities:

- **Cross-chain identity verification**: Link wallets from [Ethereum](/concepts/sui-for-ethereum.mdx), [Solana](/concepts/sui-for-solana.mdx), and other Sui addresses to your primary Sui wallet.
- **Non-transferable proof of ownership**: Receive a [soulbound NFT](/guides/developer/nft/nft-soulbound.mdx) that cryptographically verifies wallet ownership.
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Projects in the [Sui ecosystem](https://github.com/sui-foundation/awesome-sui/tree/main) can discover you based on your activity across all connected wallets.
- **Reward eligibility**: Unlock opportunities for cross-chain rewards, priority features, and [exclusive events](https://luma.com/sui-network) within the Sui network.

### Supported networks

SuiLink currently supports linking wallets cross-chain between Sui and Ethereum (Sui-to-Ethereum), and Sui and Solana (Sui-to-Solana).

Sui-to-Sui linking is currently only supported programmatically with a custom solution for the [Playtron wallet app](https://wallet.playtron.one/). For more information, visit the [SuiPlay0X1 SuiLink integration guide](/guides/suiplay0x1/wallet-integration.mdx#suilink).

## Creating a SuiLink

To create a SuiLink:

1. Visit [https://www.suilink.io/](https://www.suilink.io/)
2. Click **Connect Sui Wallet**
3. Select the blockchain network you want to link: Ethereum or Solana
4. Follow the prompts to authenticate and connect the wallet you want to link
5. Complete the transaction to mint your SuiLink NFT

Creating a SuiLink incurs a small gas fee on the Sui network to mint the NFT. Ensure you have some SUI tokens in your wallet to complete the connection.

## Managing SuiLink

Each SuiLink connection creates a separate SuiLink NFT in your Sui wallet.

To view your linked addresses:

1. View your SuiLink NFTs in your Sui wallet
2. Check the `network_address` field to see which wallets are linked
3. Review the timestamp to see when each link was created

You can permanently unlink a wallet by burning the corresponding NFT. To unlink an address:

1. Navigate to the NFTs section of your Sui wallet
2. For the SuiLink NFT you want to burn, select "Send" or "Transfer"
3. Enter the burn address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Additionally, there are various third-party tools (such as [SUI Manager](https://www.suimanager.com/burner)) that can help burn NFTs, and some wallets have a built-in burning feature.

## Integrating SuiLink

When building an application on Sui, you can integrate SuiLink to verify cross-chain ownership.

### Querying SuiLink objects

To retrieve a user's SuiLink connections, use the following gRPC query:

```typescript
const SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL = '0xf857fa9df5811e6df2a0240a1029d365db24b5026896776ddd1c3c70803bccd3';
const SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_SUI = '0x73f5ab2461c5993408fff21354fa9831d4f4a66cc81382419ec29e3c80c384b5';

const ethSolSuiLinks = await grpcClient.listOwnedObjects({
  owner: suiAddress,
  type: `${SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL}::suilink::SuiLink`,
  include: { json: true },
});

const suiSuiLinks = await grpcClient.listOwnedObjects({
  owner: suiAddress,
  type: `${SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_SUI}::suilink::SuiLink`,
  include: { json: true },
});
```

This returns all SuiLink NFTs owned by the specified Sui address.

### SuiLink NFT structure

Each SuiLink NFT contains the following fields:

```typescript
{
  "id": "0xcafe",
  "network_address": "0xdecaf",
  "timestamp_ms": "1751541273947"
}
```

The NFT type indicates which blockchain network the wallet is linked to:

```typescript
for (const link of ethSolSuiLinks.objects) {
  const id = link.json.id as string;                   // "0xcafe"
  const linkedAddress = link.json.network_address as string; // "0xdecaf"
  const timestamp = link.json.timestamp_ms as string;        // "1751541273947"
  const chainType = link.type; // full type string includes the generic param,
                               // e.g. "...::SuiLink<...::ethereum::Ethereum>"
}

// Sui-to-Sui SuiLink (Mainnet)

```

### Verifying cross-chain asset ownership

After retrieving a user's SuiLink objects, you can verify their ownership of specific assets on the linked blockchain:

1. Extract the `network_address` from the SuiLink NFT.
2. Use the appropriate blockchain APIs to query assets at that address, such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) for Ethereum, and [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) for Solana.
3. Verify the presence of the required asset.
4. Attribute benefits to the user through their Sui wallet.
