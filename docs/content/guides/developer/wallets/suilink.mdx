[SuiLink](https://www.suilink.io/) is a Mysten Labs product that allows you to securely link wallet addresses from different blockchain networks to your Sui wallet. When you create a SuiLink, you receive a soulbound NFT that serves as authenticated proof of ownership for your connected wallets.

## Key features

SuiLink provides the following capabilities:

- **Cross-chain identity verification**: Link wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other Sui addresses to your primary Sui wallet.
- **Soulbound proof of ownership**: Receive a non-transferable NFT that cryptographically verifies wallet ownership.
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Projects in the Sui ecosystem can discover you based on your activity across all connected wallets.
- **Reward eligibility**: Unlock opportunities for cross-chain rewards, priority features, and exclusive events within the Sui network.

## Supported networks

SuiLink currently supports the following cross-chain wallet links:

- Sui to Ethereum
- Sui to Solana
- Sui to Sui

Additionally, you can connect multiple wallets from the same network to a single Sui address.

## How SuiLink works

When you create a SuiLink, the system performs the following steps:

1. Connects your Sui wallet.
2. Authenticates ownership of the wallet you want to link from another blockchain.
3. Creates a cryptographic proof of ownership.
4. Generates a soulbound NFT in your Sui wallet containing the linked wallet information.

The SuiLink NFT remains in your Sui wallet as proof of ownership and cannot be transferred.

## Creating a SuiLink

To create a SuiLink:

1. Visit [https://www.suilink.io/](https://www.suilink.io/)
2. Click **Connect Sui Wallet** to connect your Sui wallet
3. Select the blockchain network you want to link (Ethereum, Solana, or another Sui address)
4. Follow the prompts to authenticate and connect the wallet you wish to link
5. Complete the transaction to mint your SuiLink NFT

Creating a SuiLink requires a small gas fee on the Sui network to mint the NFT. Ensure you have some SUI tokens in your wallet to complete the connection.

## Managing SuiLink

You can link the same Sui wallet address to multiple wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other Sui addresses. Each connection creates a separate SuiLink NFT in your Sui wallet.

To manage your linked addresses:

1. View your SuiLink NFTs in your Sui wallet
2. Check the `network_address` field to see which wallets are linked
3. Review the timestamp to see when each link was created

You can permanently unlink a wallet by burning the corresponding NFT pass.

## Integrating SuiLink

If you are building an application on Sui, you can integrate SuiLink to verify cross-chain ownership.

### Prerequisites

Before integrating SuiLink, ensure you have:

- The Sui dApp Kit SDK installed in your project
- A configured Sui client instance
- The SuiLink package IDs for your target network

### Package IDs

SuiLink uses different package IDs depending on the network and chain type:

| **Network** | **SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL** | **SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_SUI** |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Testnet | `0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a` | `0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a` |
| Mainnet | `0xf857fa9df5811e6df2a0240a1029d365db24b5026896776ddd1c3c70803bccd3` | `0x73f5ab2461c5993408fff21354fa9831d4f4a66cc81382419ec29e3c80c384b5` |

### Querying SuiLink objects

To retrieve a user's SuiLink connections, use the following dApp Kit SDK query:

```typescript
const ethSolSuiLinks = suiClient.getOwnedObjects({
  owner: suiAddress,
  filter: {
    Package: SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL,
  },
  options: {
    showContent: true,
    showType: true,
  },
});

const suiSuiLinks = suiClient.getOwnedObjects({
  owner: suiAddress,
  filter: {
    Package: SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_SUI,
  },
  options: {
    showContent: true,
    showType: true,
  },
});
```

This returns all SuiLink NFTs owned by the specified Sui address. Each NFT contains information about the linked wallet.

### SuiLink NFT structure

Each SuiLink NFT contains the following fields:

```typescript
{
  id: {
    id: "0xcafe"
  },
  network_address: "0xdecaf",
  timestamp_ms: "1751541273947"
}
```

The NFT type indicates which blockchain network the wallet is linked to:

```typescript
// Sui to Sui SuiLink (Mainnet)
0xf857fa9df5811e6df2a0240a1029d365db24b5026896776ddd1c3c70803bccd3::suilink::SuiLink<0x73f5ab2461c5993408fff21354fa9831d4f4a66cc81382419ec29e3c80c384b5::sui::Sui>

// Sui to Ethereum SuiLink (Testnet)
0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::suilink::SuiLink<0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::ethereum::Ethereum>

// Sui to Solana SuiLink (Testnet)
0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::suilink::SuiLink<0x0025bafa2e6afa511c19bd4e95626c897e798fde629b4782fe061bdc8bd65c8a::solana::Solana>
```

### Verifying cross-chain asset ownership

After retrieving a user's SuiLink objects, you can verify their ownership of specific assets on the linked blockchain:

1. Extract the `network_address` from the SuiLink NFT
2. Use the appropriate blockchain API to query assets at that address
3. Verify the presence of the required asset
4. Attribute benefits to the user through their Sui wallet

For example, to verify Ethereum assets:

```typescript
// Get the user's SuiLink objects
const suilinks = await suiClient.getOwnedObjects({
  owner: userSuiAddress,
  filter: { Package: SUILINK_PACKAGE_ID_ETH_SOL },
  options: { showContent: true, showType: true },
});

// Extract linked Ethereum addresses
const ethereumAddresses = suilinks.data
  .filter(obj => obj.type.includes('ethereum::Ethereum'))
  .map(obj => obj.fields.network_address);

// Query Ethereum blockchain for assets at these addresses
for (const ethAddress of ethereumAddresses) {
  const assets = await fetchEthereumAssets(ethAddress); // Use Alchemy or similar
  
  if (assets.includes(requiredNFT)) {
    // Grant benefit to user through their Sui wallet
    grantBenefit(userSuiAddress);
  }
}
```

## SuiPlay0X1 integration

The [Playtron companion wallet app](https://wallet.playtron.one/) uses SuiLink to enable linking wallets that could contain soulbound assets in their other Sui mnemonic or zkLogin wallets, or their Solana or Ethereum wallets. This offers an improved user experience as users won’t need to transfer over all of their assets to their Playtron wallet to get the benefits these assets attribute to them.

:::info

You can prove ownership of another wallet or asset and link it to your Playtron wallet (thereby allowing the game to read those assets), but you can't transact with these assets. For operations that require transactions to occur from the Playtron wallet, assets need to be transferred.

:::

### Read-only versus transactional access

When using SuiLink with the Playtron wallet:

- **Read access**: Games can verify ownership of assets in linked wallets without requiring transfers.
- **Transactional access**: Users must transfer assets from linked wallets to their Playtron wallet to use them in transactions.
