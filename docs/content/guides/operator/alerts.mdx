title: Sui Validator Alert Reference
description: A collection of the Prometheus Alertmanager rules that trigger alerts and warnings on Validator and Full nodes.
---

When running a Sui Validator node or Full node, there are Prometheus Alertmanager rules that might trigger alerts and warnings.

## Install/configure Alertmanager

Could use some direction/information on this: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-operations/blob/5c5e0034f47a7648dcad318c5f6be9a9f9880b87/alerting/README.md.

## Alert reference 

The following sections cover the alert settings, but their details are meant to be customized in the following ways:

- Replace `$network` with your actual network label (for example, `mainnet`, `testnet`, and so on).
- Thresholds assume about 10,000 stake units — adjust for your own validator set size.
- Labels like `host` and `container` are stripped to be agnostic on infrastructure.

## 🔥 High-priority chain health alerts

These alerts should receive the most immediate attention from you or your team.
