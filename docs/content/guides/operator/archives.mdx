title: Sui Archives
description: The archive is a historical record of all transactions on Sui. Enable archiving on your Full nodes as a best practice.
---

A Sui archive is a history of all transaction data on Sui. In some cases, peer nodes may not catch up with all transactions and effects through synchronization if they lag behind the current epoch by more than the latest few epochs. In such cases, instead of relying on synchronization, peer nodes can fallback to downloading the relevant information from an archive.

:::info
Starting with the 1.49 release, the existing special archive format is being deprecated in favor of a generic data ingestion format. Please migrate your configs using the configuration example that follows. The deprecated configuration is currently included for reference, but will be removed after a few releases.

## Set up archival fallback (latest) {#set-up-archival-fallback}

To enable your node to fallback to an archive in case of lag, add this to your fullnode.yaml file:

<Tabs groupId="object-store">
<TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">

```yaml
state-archive-read-config:
  - ingestion-url: "https://checkpoints.mainnet.sui.io"
    # How many objects to read ahead when catching up
    concurrency: 5
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```yaml
state-archive-read-config:
  - ingestion-url: "https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io"
    # How many objects to read ahead when catching up
    concurrency: 5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Set up archival fallback(deprecated) {#set-up-archival-fallback-deprecated}
<Tabs groupId="object-store">
<TabItem value="s3" label="Amazon S3">
```yaml
state-archive-read-config:

      object-store: "S3"
      # Use mysten-testnet-archives for testnet

      bucket: "mysten-<testnet|mainnet>-archives"
      # you can either provide your own aws credentials via "aws-secret-access-key" and
      # "aws-access-key-id" or set no-sign-request: true

      aws-region: "us-west-2"
      object-store-connection-limit: 20
    concurrency: 5
    # Whether to prune local state based on latest checkpoint in archive.
    # This should stay false for most use cases
    use-for-pruning-watermark: false

<TabItem value="gcs" label="Google Cloud Storage">
