:::info

These instructions are for advanced users. If you just need a local development environment, you should instead follow the instructions in [Create a Local Sui Network](../developer/getting-started/local-network.mdx) to create a local Full node, validators, and faucet.

:::

Nodes expose on `localhost:9184/metrics` by default.

You can view the metrics in the metrics UI, or you can use a tool like `curl` to get the metrics in a format that is easy to parse.

```sh
$ curl -s http://localhost:9184/metrics | grep -E 'sui_validator|sui_fullnode'
```

## Production monitoring

For production monitoring, we recommend using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

You can use grafana agent, grafana alloy, or another tool to scrape the metrics from your node.
