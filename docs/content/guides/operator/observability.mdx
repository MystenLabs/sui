title: Logging, Tracing, Metrics, and Observability
sidebar_label: Observability
draft: true
---

Good observability capabilities are key to the development and growth of Sui. This is made more challenging by the distributed and asynchronous nature of Sui, with multiple client and validator processes distributed over a potentially global network.

The observability stack in Sui is based on the [Tokio tracing](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-08-tracing) library. The rest of this document highlights specific aspects of achieving good observability through structured logging and metrics in Sui.

:::info

The output here is largely for the consumption of Sui operators, administrators, and developers. The content of logs and traces do not represent the authoritative, certified output of validators and are subject to potentially byzantine behavior.

## Contexts, scopes, and tracing transaction flow {#context-scope-trace}

In a distributed and asynchronous system like Sui, one cannot rely on looking at individual logs over time in a single thread. To solve this problem, use the approach of structured logging. Structured logging offers a way to tie together logs, events, and blocks of functionality across threads and process boundaries.

### Spans and events {#spans-and-events}

In the [Tokio tracing](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-08-tracing) library, structured logging is implemented using [spans and events](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.31/tracing/index.html#core-concepts).
Spans cover a whole block of functionality - like one function call, a future or asynchronous task, etc. They can be nested, and key-value pairs in spans give context to events or logs inside the function.

- spans and their key-value pairs add essential context to enclosed logs, such as a transaction ID.
- spans also track time spent in different sections of code, enabling distributed tracing functionality.
- individual logs can also add key-value pairs to aid in parsing, filtering and aggregation.

Here is a list of context information of interest:

- TX Digest
- Object references/ID, when applicable
- Address
- Certificate digest, if applicable
- For Client HTTP endpoint: route, method, status
- Epoch
- Host information, for both clients and validators

In the digest, `process_tx` is a span that covers handling the initial transaction request, and "Checked locks" is a single log message within the transaction handling method in the validator.

Every log message that occurs within the span inherits the key-value properties defined in the span, including the `tx_digest` and any other fields that are added. Log messages can set their own keys and values. The fact that logs inherit the span properties allows you to trace, for example, the flow of a transaction across thread and process boundaries.

## Key-value pairs schema {#key-value-pairs-schema}

Spans capture not a single event but an entire block of time; so start, end, duration, etc. can be captured and analyzed for tracing, performance analysis, and so on.

### Tags - keys {#tags-keys}

The idea is that every event and span would get tagged with key-value pairs. Events that log within any context or nested contexts would also inherit the context-level tags.

These tags represent _fields_ that can be analyzed and filtered by. For example, one could filter out broadcasts and see the errors for all instances where the bad stake exceeded a certain amount, but not enough for an error.

## Logging levels {#logging-levels}

This is always tricky, to balance the right amount of verbosity especially by default -- while keeping in mind this is a high performance system.

| Level | Type of Messages                                                                                           |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error | Process-level faults (not transaction-level errors, there could be a ton of those)                         |
| Warn  | Unusual or byzantine activity                                                                              |
| Info  | High level aggregate stats, major events related to data sync, epoch changes.                              |
| Debug | High level tracing for individual transactions, eg Gateway/client side -> validator -> Move execution etc. |
| Trace | Extremely detailed tracing for individual transactions                                                     |
|       |                                                                                                            |

Going from info to debug results in a much larger spew of messages.

Use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to set both the overall logging level as well as the level for individual components. Filtering down to specific spans or tags within spans is even possible.

For more details, see the [EnvFilter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) topic.

## Metrics {#metrics}

Sui includes Prometheus-based metrics:

- `rpc_requests_by_route` and related for RPC Server API metrics and latencies (see `rpc-server.rs`)
- Validator transaction metrics (see `AuthorityMetrics` in `authority.rs`)

## Viewing logs, traces, metrics {#viewing-logs-traces-metrics}

The tracing architecture is based on the idea of [subscribers](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing#project-layout) which can be plugged into the tracing library to process and forward output to different sinks for viewing. Multiple subscribers can be active at the same time.

You can feed JSON logs, for example, through a local sidecar log forwarder such as [Vector](https://vector.dev), and then onwards to destinations such as ElasticSearch.

The use of a log and metrics aggregator such as Vector allows for easy reconfiguration without interrupting the validator server, as well as offloading observability traffic.

Metrics: served with a Prometheus scrape endpoint, by default at `<host>:9184/metrics`.

### Stdout (default) {#stdout-default}

By default, logs (but not spans) are formatted for human readability and output to stdout, with key-value tags at the end of every line.

You can configure `RUST_LOG` for custom logging output, including filtering - see the [Logging levels](#logging-levels) section earlier in this topic.

### Tracing and span output {#tracing-and-span-output}

To generate detailed span start and end logs, define the `SUI_JSON_SPAN_LOGS` environment variable. This causes all output to be in JSON format, which is not as human-readable, so it is not enabled by default.

You can send this output to a tool or service for indexing, alerts, aggregation, and analysis.

The following example output shows certificate processing in the authority with span logging. Note the `START` and `END` annotations, and notice how `DB_UPDATE_STATE` which is nested is embedded within `PROCESS_CERT`. Also notice `elapsed_milliseconds`, which logs the duration of each span.

```bash

### Jaeger (seeing distributed traces) {#jaeger}

To see nested spans visualized with [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), do the following:

1.  Run this to get a local Jaeger container:

```bash
docker run -d -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

1.  Run Sui like this (trace enables the most detailed spans):

```bash
SUI_TRACING_ENABLE=1 RUST_LOG="info,sui_core=trace" ./sui start
```

1.  Run some transfers with Sui CLI client, or run the benchmarking tool.
1.  Browse to `http://localhost:16686/` and select Sui as the service.

:::info

Separate spans (that are not nested) are not connected as a single trace for now.

### Live async inspection / Tokio Console {#tokio-console}

[Tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) is an awesome CLI tool designed to analyze and help debug Rust apps using Tokio, in real time! It relies on a special subscriber.

1.  Build Sui using a special flag: `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo build`.
1.  Start Sui with `SUI_TOKIO_CONSOLE` set to 1.
1.  Clone the console repo and `cargo run` to launch the console.

:::tip

Adding Tokio-console support might significantly slow down Sui validators/gateways.

### Memory profiling {#memory-profiling}

Sui uses the [jemalloc memory allocator](https://jemalloc.net/) by default on most platforms, and there is code that enables automatic memory profiling using jemalloc's sampling profiler, which is very lightweight and designed for production use. The profiling code spits out profiles at most every 5 minutes, and only when total memory has increased by a default 20%. Profiling files are named `jeprof.<TIMESTAMP>.<memorysize>MB.prof` so that it is easy to
correlate to metrics and incidents, for ease of debugging.

For the memory profiling to work, you need to set the environment variable `_RJEM_MALLOC_CONF=prof:true`. If you use the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysten/sui-node) they are set automatically.

Running some allocator-based heap profilers such as [Bytehound](https://github.com/koute/bytehound) will essentially disable automatic jemalloc profiling, because they interfere with or don't implement `jemalloc_ctl` stats APIs.

To view the profile files, one needs to do the following, on the same platform as where the profiles were gathered:

1.  Install `libunwind`, the `dot` utility from graphviz, and jeprof. On Debian: `apt-get install libjemalloc-dev libunwind-dev graphviz`.
1.  Build with debug symbols: `cargo build --profile bench-profiling`
1.  cd to `$SUI_REPO/target/bench-profiling`
1.  Run `jeprof --svg sui-node jeprof.xxyyzz.heap` - select the heap profile based on
    timestamp and memory size in the filename.

:::tip

With automatic memory profiling, it is no longer necessary to configure environment variables beyond those previously listed. It is possible to configure custom profiling options:

- [Heap Profiling](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Use-Case%3A-Heap-Profiling)
- [heap profiling with jemallocator](https://gist.github.com/ordian/928dc2bd45022cddd547528f64db9174)

For example, set `_RJEM_MALLOC_CONF` to:
`prof:true,lg_prof_interval:24,lg_prof_sample:19`

The preceding setting means: turn on profiling, sample every 2^19 or 512KB bytes allocated, and dump out the profile every 2^24 or 16MB of memory allocated. However, the automatic profiling is designed to produce files that are better named and at less intervals, so overriding the default configuration is not usually recommended.
