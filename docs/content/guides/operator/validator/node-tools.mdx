This guide focuses on using the Sui CLI `validator` commands. 

:::info

This tool only supports pending validators and active validators.

<Tabs className="tabsHeadingCentered">
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites">

- [x] Complete all [Sui installation prerequisites](../../developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx#prerequisites).

- [x] Build the `sui` binary, which you need for the genesis ceremony. This can be done on any machine, it does not have to be done on the machine that will run the validator.

    1. Clone the git repo:

           `$ git clone git@github.com:MystenLabs/sui.git && cd sui`

    2. Check out the commit to use for the testnet:

           `$ git checkout testnet`

    3. Build sui binary

           `$ cargo build --bin sui`

    4. Remember the path to your binary:

           `$ export SUI_BINARY="$(pwd)/target/debug/sui"`

</details>

- [x] Set up your Sui account and CLI environment.

    - If this is the first time running this program, it will ask you to provide a Sui full node server URL and a meaningful environment alias. It will also generate a random key pair in `sui.keystore` and a config `client.yaml`. Swap in your validator account key if you already have one.

       If you cannot find where `client.yaml` or `sui.keystore` is, or have other questions, read the [Sui client CLI tutorial](/references/cli/client.mdx).

       ```sh
       $ sui client
       ```

    - If you already set it up, simply make sure:
      - `rpc` is correct in `client.yaml`. 
      - `active_address` is correct in `client.yaml`.
      - `sui.keystore` contains your account key pair.

</details>

- [x] Test your network connection and configuration by displaying your validator info:

```sh
$ sui validator display-metadata
```

## Using Sui CLI 

### Print help info

```sh
$ sui validator --help
```

### Become a validator / join committee

To become a validator candidate, first run:

```sh
$ sui validator make-validator-info <name> <description> <image-url> <project-url> <host-name> <gas_price>
```

This will generate a `validator.info` file and key pair files. The output of this command includes:
  1. Four [key pair files](./validator-tasks.mdx#key-management). **Set their permissions with the minimal visibility (`chmod 600`, for example) and store them securely**. They are needed when running the validator node as covered below.
    a. If you follow this guide thoroughly, this key pair is actually copied from your `sui.keystore` file.
  2. `validator.info` file that contains your validator info. **Double check all information is correct**.

Then run:

```sh
$ sui validator become-candidate {path-to}validator.info
```

This submits an on-chain transaction for you to become a validator candidate. The parameter is the file path to the `validator.info` file generated in the previous step. **Make sure the transaction succeeds (printed in the output).**

At this point, you are validator candidate and can start to accept self-staking and delegated staking. 

**If you haven't, start a full node now to catch up with the network. When you officially join the committee but are not fully up-to-date, you cannot make meaningful contributions to the network and may be subject to peer reporting. This imposes the risk of reduced staking rewards for you and your delegator.**

Then, you must acquire 30M SUI and stake it to the validator staking pool. You can add Sui to the validator staking pool with the command:

```sh
$ sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_add_stake --args 0x5 {sui_object_id} {validator_address}
```

This creates a stake object (of type `0x3::staking_pool::StakedSui`). This object can be withdrawn with the following command:

```sh
$ sui client call --package 0x3 --module sui_system --function request_withdraw_stake --args 0x5 {stake_object_id}
```

:::tip 
You cannot withdraw non-activated stake from an inactive validator. If that is the case, you should be able to withdraw after the next epoch change when the stake becomes active. 
:::

Once you have staked enough, run:

```sh
$ sui validator join-committee
```

Joining the committee will make you a pending validator. A pending validator will become active and join the committee starting from next epoch.


### Leave committee

To leave the committee, run:

```sh
$ sui validator leave-committee
```

You are removed from the committee starting from the next epoch.

### Proof of possession: Generate the payload

Serialize the payload that is used to generate proof of possession. This allows the signer to take the payload offline for an authority protocol BLS key pair to sign.

```sh
$ sui validator serialize-payload-pop --account-address $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --protocol-public-key $BLS_PUBKEY
```

```sh
Serialized payload: $PAYLOAD_TO_SIGN
```

### Display validator metadata

Display metadata about your local validator:

```sh
$ sui validator display-metadata
```

Display metadata about another validator via validator address

```sh
$ sui validator display-metadata <validator-address>
```

### Update validator metadata

Run the following to see how to update validator metadata. Read description carefully about when the change will take effect.

```sh
$ sui validator update-metadata --help
```

You can update the following on-chain metadata:
1. Name
1. Description
1. Image URL
1. Project URL
1. Network address
1. P2P address
1. Primary address
1. Worker address
1. Protocol public key
1. Network public key
1. Worker public key

:::info 
Only the first 4 metadata listed above take effect immediately. Others will be changed only after the next epoch. For those, you'll want to restart the validator program immediately after the next epoch, with the new key files and/or updated `validator.yaml` config. 

Particularly, make sure the new address is not behind a firewall.
:::

Run the following to see how to update each metadata.

```sh
$ sui validator update-metadata --help
```

### Operation Cap

Operation Cap allows a validator to authorize another account to perform certain actions on behalf of this validator. [Learn more about Operation Cap](./validator-tasks.mdx#operation-cap).

The Operation Cap holder (either the validator itself or the delegatee) updates its gas price and reports validator peers with the Operation Cap.

### Update gas price

If the account itself is a validator and holds the Operation Cap, update the gas price with:

```sh
$ sui validator update-gas-price <gas-price>
```

If the account is a delegatee:

```sh
$ sui validator update-gas-price --operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id> <gas-price>
```

### Report validators

If the account itself is a validator and holds the Operation Cap, report validators peers with:

```sh
$ sui validator report-validator <reportee-address>
```

Add `--undo-report false` if it intends to undo an existing report.

Similarly, if the account is a delegatee, add `--operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id>` option to the command.

If the account is a delegatee, run:

```sh
$ sui validator update-gas-price --operation-cap-id <operation-cap-id> <gas-price>
```
