There are some best practices to consider when developing for SuiPlay0X1. 

## Handling transactions

Avoid frequent micro-transactions: If players are using their self-custody wallets and transactions require explicit player signatures, then you should avoid frequent micro-transactions, particularly during gameplay. Signing a transaction requires popping up an on-device visual element or an off-device browser dialog to approve, breaking the gameplay flow. This is not a concern if you are managing custodial wallets on behalf of the player. See [Wallet Integration Options](./wallet-integration.mdx) for more information on available wallet integrations.

Many on-chain actions do not require explicit user approval. For example, dropping rewards to a user, incrementing their currency, and so on. The game can be handle these whenever appropriate, even silently in the background during gameplay.

## Managing gas

If using a third-party wallet service ([Beamable](https://beamable.com/), [Shinami](https://www.shinami.com/)), leverage gas sponsorship for custodial implementations to abstract from users. Consider tradeoffs between aggregated and individual wallets and batch transactions whenever possible to reduce gas costs.

## Data management

Proper data management design can augment the user experience.

### On-chain versus off-chain storage

Consider where best to store your data:

- **On-chain:** Assets and currencies that can be traded or sold.  
- **Off-chain:** Game state, progress, and so on using traditional game servers.

While you can store any information on-chain, consider whether itâ€™s important to your game for that data to exist there. If not, leverage traditional game server backends, which makes data syncing and updating easier.

### Session start protocol

Always check wallet state at session beginning and don't cache wallet data between sessions as assets can change externally.
