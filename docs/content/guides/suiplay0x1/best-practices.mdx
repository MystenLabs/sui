## **Handling transactions**

If players are using their self-custody wallets, and transactions require explicit player signatures (as opposed to if you are managing custodial wallets on behalf of the player), then you should avoid frequent micro-transactions, particularly during gameplay. Signing a transaction will require popping up an OS UI element (on device) or a web browser (off device) to approve, and breaks the gameplay flow.

Many on-chain actions do not require explicit user approval. For example, dropping rewards to a user, incrementing their currency, etc. These can be handled whenever appropriate by the game, even silently in the background during gameplay.

**Managing Gas**

* If using a third-party wallet service (Beamable, Shinami), leverage gas sponsorship for custodial implementations to abstract from users  
* Consider tradeoffs between aggregated and individual wallets  
* Batch transactions when possible to reduce gas costs

## **Data Management Best Practices**

**On-Chain vs Off-Chain Storage**

* **On-Chain**: Assets / currencies that can be traded/sold  
* **Off-Chain**: Game state, progress, etc using traditional game servers

While you can store any information on-chain, consider whether itâ€™s important to your game for that data to exist on-chain. If not, leverage traditional game server backends, which will make data syncing and updating easier.

**Session Start Protocol**

* Always check wallet state at session beginning  
* Don't cache wallet data between sessions (assets may change externally)
