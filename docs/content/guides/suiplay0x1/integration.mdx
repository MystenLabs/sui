Your integration options depend on the environments you expect your users to interact with your game. 

## On device integration

For on-device game integration, you need the [Playtron GameOS SDK](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-sdk). The SDK provides access to OS-level features, such as environment detection, remote PACT attestation, virtual keyboard and browser utilities, and Sui wallet integration.

The Playtron GameOS SDK repository contains the installation and initialization steps to begin development. The repository also contains examples on how to use the SDK in C++, C#, and Node.js environments. The .dll build files needed to compile the C++ code are provided. For the C# and Node.js examples, you can install the necessary dependencies from the respective package manager.

The Playtron GameOS SDK provides automatic wallet access with the following benefits:

- Users already have a Playtron wallet through their Playtron account.
- No additional wallet setup required on-device.
- Games can immediately access wallet functions through the SDK.

## Off-device integration

For off-device integration, use the [Sui dApp Kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit). By integrating the Sui dApp Kit, your game can continue to use the Playtron zkLogin wallet when not running directly on the SuiPlay0X1 device. This is useful if your game is available on the web, desktop, or mobile devices.

The Sui dApp Kit documentation site (linked in the previous paragraph), provides the installation instructions for the SDK. With the SDK integrated into your gaming project, you can enable Playtron zkLogin wallet as a connection option.
 
The dApp Kit runs in TypeScript, meaning your game needs TypeScript processing to integrate with this SDK. If your game is a web-based game, or you navigate users to a browser to perform Web3 transactions on your associated website, this should not be an issue. 

If you're unable to run TypeScript, you can always support sending assets from your wallet to the Playtron wallet. Users can also access their Playtron wallet address via the [companion web application](https://wallet.playtron.one). Finally, you can support sending assets from your game on a different platform. For example, the user can use your PC client to transfer assets to their Playtron wallet, then continue playing on-device.

### Supported wallet types

* **Playtron wallet:** Seamless continuation from on-device sessions.  
* **Self-custody options:** Support for any wallet available through the Sui dApp Kit (such as [Slush wallet](https://slush.app/), [Phantom](https://phantom.com/), [Backpack](https://backpack.app/)) to include future wallet integrations.
