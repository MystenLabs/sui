title: Broader Sui Ecosystem Support
---

{@include: ../../snippets/suiplay.mdx}

The SuiPlay0x1 is one part of a larger ecosystem of Sui gaming. Users might play your game for the first time on the device, and later decide to continue playing your game on PC. Or they might have already played your game before on PC with their own mnemonic wallet, and want to continue playing on the device.

As a result, it’s important to consider the different possible migration flows for your game both for new users and existing ones.

## On device ⇒ off device

If a user starts playing your game on device first, and you have added support using dApp Kit, then their Playtron wallet is their primary wallet. Off-device play is automatically supported with the same wallet.

**Automatic transition**

- Integrate Sui dApp Kit in your off-device version.
- Enable Playtron wallet as connection option.
- Users can seamlessly continue with same wallet across platforms.

:::info

The Playtron wallet is portable and can connect to any dApp using the Sui dApp Kit.

:::

**Asset management**

- All assets remain accessible across platforms.
- No manual transfer required.
- Users can connect their Playtron wallet to marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and other dApps that support Playtron wallet.

## Off device ⇒ on device

If a user starts playing your game off device first, their primary wallet depends on what wallet architecture you choose in your game design (custodial, self-custody, or game-specific zkLogin). Depending on what kind of wallet interactions your game requires during gameplay, you have different options for supporting cross-device gameplay. To learn more about wallet options, see [Wallet Integration Options](./migration-strategies.mdx).

### Read-only asset access

If your game only needs to read the list of assets from a wallet during gameplay (for example, to determine if a user owns an NFT to grant them status in game), then users can link their Playtron wallet to their existing self-custody wallet.

Examples where read-only is adequate:

- Soulbound assets, such as a proof of attendance protocol (POAP).
- An NFT representing membership access. 
- An NFT representing an unlocked skin that can’t be transacted on while playing the game (but can be traded separately on a third-party NFT marketplace).

Users login to the Playtron wallet via the companion web site ([https://wallet.playtron.one](https://wallet.playtron.one)) to link their Playtron wallet to their existing wallet. This works for tying the Playtron wallet to self-custody wallets. This doesn't work for tying to custodial wallets, but that shouldn't be necessary as your game's backend can track users' assets across devices (such as through a user id or Steam/EGS login).

If you are using a game-specific zkLogin wallet, a properly configured [Enoki Connect](https://docs.enoki.mystenlabs.com/enoki-connect) can link your game-specific zkLogin wallet with the Playtron wallet.  

Games can read from the linked wallet and act based on contents. There are no transaction capabilities with linked assets, however.

### Full asset access

If your game requires the user to sign or approve transactions to act on assets in their wallet during gameplay, users need to transfer their assets from their existing self-custody wallet to their Playtron zkLogin wallet. Examples where you might need full asset access include:

- Tokens that represent game currency and users can spend during the course of gameplay.
- NFTs that can be traded from inside your game that require signed transactions.

For self-custody and game-specific zkLogin wallets, users must transfer assets from original self-custody wallets to Playtron wallets. For custodial wallets, there is no need as your game backend can track the user’s assets across devices (such as through a user id or Steam/EGS login).

Transfer enables full transaction capabilities on device. The companion web app provides user-friendly transfer flows  

:::tip

If you are using a game-specific zkLogin wallet, to use the companion web app requires Enoki Connect support.
