title: Wallet Integration Options
---

{@include: ../../snippets/suiplay.mdx}

You have several options for what wallet you develop for on the SuiPlay0x1. There are some concepts to keep in mind when deciding which wallets to target.

- [Custodial wallets](#custodial-wallets): Developers manage wallets on behalf of users (similar to traditional gaming databases) except on chain. Users don't need to create or bring a wallet, or to even understand what a wallet is. This smooths out the initial experience, but you still need to confront this issue downstream for users to actually benefit from the Web3 aspects of your game.
- [Self-custodial wallets](#self-custodial-wallets): Users control their private keys and own their assets directly.
- [zkLogin wallets](#zkLogin-wallets): Traditional zkLogin wallets (or [Enoki](https://enoki.mystenlabs.com/) wallets) are a unique wallet type to Sui. zkLogin wallets are tied to a Web2 auth provider (such as Google OAuth). The user authenticates with their traditional auth provider, which associates a wallet to their social account by utilizing zero knowledge proofs. This grants them access to their zkLogin wallet through an ephemeral key pair that does not correlate auth provider user metadata with their on-chain attributed address. If the ephemeral key pair resides on the client side, the zkLogin wallet is self-custodial.
- [Playtron zkLogin wallet](#playtron-zkLogin-wallet): The Playtron zkLogin wallet is a special zkLogin wallet tied to the user's Playtron credentials. Every user who has a SuiPlay0x1 device has a Playtron login, and therefore possess an associated Playtron zkLogin wallet.

### Custodial wallets {#custodial-wallets}

Custodial wallets can either be aggregated or individual. In the aggregated case, all user assets are pooled together in a single wallet, and the game uses an off-chain database to track which assets belong to which individuals. Transferring assets between players does not result in any on-chain activity, only a database update. For example, if player A sells a sword to player B, you capture the object swap in a database rather than performing an on-chain transaction.

Aggregated custodial wallets can obfuscate some on-chain metrics, which can be an issue if you want external verification of your game's on-chain activity through third parties or Sui network explorers. For example, if you launch a token for your game, potential investors can't assess how many active players your dApp has if your game uses an aggregated wallet.

:::

In the individual case, each user gets their own custodial wallet that you manage as the game developer. Transferring assets between players results in on-chain activity and you pay the gas fee costs.

- Custodial wallets can not be used by users to interact with other third-party dApps on chain (e.g., NFT marketplaces)
- Be careful when selecting a 3rd party custodial wallet provider – this may have downstream risks if the wallet vendor goes out of business.

### Self-custodial wallets {#self-custodial-wallets}

- If a user already has a wallet, they are likely familiar with wallet / seed phrase security and storage, but if they are completely new to web3, you will need to guide them through getting a wallet.
- Users (typically) pay for their own gas for transactions - this reduces developer costs, but requires users to fund their wallets to perform transactions. This results in one active wallet per user playing the game.
- It is possible to sponsor transactions for users, reducing friction for users. This is worth considering doing for some limited number of early transactions, especially for new users as it makes the wallet onboarding process smoother.
- Self-custodial wallets have the most portability in terms of being able to interact with any 3rd party dApp on-chain.

### zkLogin wallets {#zkLogin-wallets}


- This eliminates the need for writing down seed phrases or otherwise securely storing your private key.
- One historical drawback for zkLogin wallets is that they are siloed to the app. That is, if you use a Google auth-based zkLogin wallet for your game, even if the user signs in with the same Google credentials to access their zkLogin wallet for a different dApp or game, that will result in a different wallet from the one for your game. zkLogin wallets are historically not portable across dApps.
- We have recently added the ability to extend these zkLogin / Enoki wallets via functionality called “Enoki Connect”. By upgrading a zkLogin wallet to Enoki connect, you can increase the portability of your game’s zkLogin wallet. See the Enoki Connect section for more details.
NOTE on same auth not being the being same

### Playtron zkLogin wallet {#playtron-zkLogin-wallet}

The Playtron zkLogin wallet is unique for a few reasons:
- The Playtron zkLogin wallet has direct integrations with the GameOS running on the SuiPlay0x1, allowing the user to sign transactions seamlessly on the device.
- The Playtron wallet already supports Enoki Connect out of the box, and is therefore portable across dApps.
- A companion web application is in development to support linking the Playtron wallet to other self-custodied wallets via Sui Link, enabling read-access of associated wallets while on the device.



## Selecting the optimal wallet integration

The best wallet to select for your dApp depends on the goals of your project. There is usually not a single, best solution, but some choices are better than others when weighing the tradeoffs between different approaches.

## Requirements

While the wallet strategy is left to the developer, there are some requirements for working with the SuiPlay0x1:

### On device

Games that run on the SuiPlay0x1 device must support the Playtron zkLogin wallet as the default option.  

You can't require users to sign transactions off device for gameplay while playing on the SuiPlay0x1.  

There is no guarantee that players have access to their other self-custody wallets or can access a non-Playtron zkLogin wallet.

### Off device (on Windows PC, for example,) 

Games that run on different platforms must use the Sui [dApp kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) to enable cross-platform play with the same wallet.

## Wallet strategies

The following strategies offer some recommendations on how to best address the scenarios' needs.

### Option 1: Playtron zkLogin wallet \+ dApp kit combo (Recommended)

* On device, the game uses the Playtron zkLogin wallet as default. 
* Off device, the game uses dApp kit to enable the user to use the Playtron wallet, or bring their own self-custody wallet through a web portal. 
* If the user has initially played off device with their own self-custody wallet, they can use our companion app to link their wallet to their Playtron zkLogin wallet.
  * If playing the game only requires read access, then the game can run on device and read their linked self-custody wallet and function normally  
  * If playing the game requires transacting, then users can transfer assets from their self-custody wallet to their Playtron wallet (facilitated by the companion app)

**Benefits**

* Users maintain control of their private keys  
* Seamless transition between on-device and off-device gameplay  
* Enhanced security and user sovereignty  
* On device, the wallet experience is seamless and familiar to traditional gamers  
* Users who have existing wallets can still use them off-device

On the SuiPlay0x1 device, the game should use the Playtron zkLogin wallet as default. Off the device, users can continue with their Playtron zkLogin wallet (assuming you have integrated the dApp kit SDK).

### 

### **Option 2: Custodial Wallets with Per-User Allocation**

* Create individual custodial wallets for each user (not shared wallets)  
* Manage these wallets on behalf of the user (typically via some 3rd party service like Beamable)  
* Support transfer of assets out of the custodial wallet to a self-custody wallet via dAppkit SDK

**Tradeoffs**

* Balances driving on-chain active wallet metrics with UX and obfuscating wallet mechanics from the user  
* Note: Asset transfers between users still incur gas costs, which the developer pays for  
* No wallet recovery mechanisms \- relies on developer/backend provider  
* Ultimately in web3, you can’t avoid having a wallet if you want to experience any of the benefits of the ecosystem. With the Playtron ecosystem we provide this – the game OS will show your assets, and our companion app will always serve game-centric wallet needs. If you use a custodial wallet, you will have to consider how you meet these user needs such as showing them their assets, teaching them how to transfer assets, etc.

### 

### **Option 3: Game-specific zkLogin Wallets with Playtron Wallet Transfer Support**

This option is effectively a special case of option 1\. If your game uses a game-specific zkLogin wallet, you will still need to support using the Playtron wallet on the device.

* Use game-specific zkLogin wallet as primary wallet when playing off the device  
* If a new user *starts* on device, use the Playtron zkLogin wallet  
* If a user has initially played the game off the device using your game-specific zkLogin wallet, they can use our companion app to link their wallet and/or transfer assets from that wallet to their Playtron zkLogin wallet to continue playing on device (see [Cross-Platform Migration](?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.q3lulqjb2w2k) above)  
  * Note: Connecting your zkLogin wallet to the companion app will require you to upgrade your wallet to Enoki Connect (see below)  
  * Once a user connects their wallet to the companion app, they will be able to link their game-specific zkLogin wallet to the Playtron wallet  
    * If your game requires read-only access, then this link should be sufficient  
    * If your game requires full asset access, players will need to transfer assets from their game-specific wallet to the Platyron wallet

**Tradeoffs**

* Provides on-chain wallet activity per user, while still maintaining simple UX and obfuscating wallet mechanics from the user  
* Unlike custodial wallets, users still need to pay for gas, though you can still [sponsor transactions](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/sponsored-transactions)  
* Wallet is self-custodied by the user in the sense that as the game developer you do not have access to the private keys, but users do not need to record/protect seed phrases  
* Ultimately in web3, you can’t avoid having a wallet if you want to experience any of the benefits of the ecosystem. With the Playtron ecosystem we provide this – the game OS will show your assets, and our companion app will always serve game-centric wallet needs. If you use a game-specific zkLogin wallet, you will have to consider how you meet these user needs such as showing them their assets, teaching them how to transfer assets, etc.

## **Enoki Connect (Optional)**

As a reminder, standard game-specific zkLogin / Enoki wallets are app-specific and non-portable. Users must transfer assets to third-party wallets to use external dApps. This provides a simpler implementation, but isolated UX.

With Enoki Connect, you can upgrade your game-specific zkLogin wallet to make it portable across the Sui ecosystem.

* Users can connect their game wallet directly to marketplaces and other dApps  
* However, external dApps must manually add your game's wallet to their supported wallet list – i.e., this requires outreach / BD by developers, and dApps must individually enable your game-specific wallet to have it appear in the list of connectable wallets on their sites  
* Requires additional implementation work to upgrade an existing game-specific zkLogin / Enoki wallet

### **Recommended Hybrid Approach**

* Use dApp kit to support self-custody wallet (either Playtron wallet on device, or Slush wallet off-device) as your primary/default wallet option  
* Provides immediate ecosystem portability without requiring other dApps to support you  
* Optionally offer Enoki Connect as a secondary option for users who prefer game-specific wallets or are unable to set up a self-custody wallet off-device

**Important**: Enoki Connect is not required for SuiPlay integration. The Playtron wallet provides ecosystem portability out of the box.
