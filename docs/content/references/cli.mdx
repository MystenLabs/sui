Sui provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the Sui network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the Sui CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: Sui Client CLI, Sui Keytool CLI, Sui Move CLI, and Sui Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

The recommended way to manage Sui CLI installations and versions is via `suiup`: https://github.com/mystenLabs/suiup.

The `tracing` feature is important as it adds Move test coverage and debugger support in the Sui CLI. Unless it is enabled you will not be able to use these two features.
