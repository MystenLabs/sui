Sui provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the Sui network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the Sui CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: Sui Client CLI, Sui Console CLI, Sui Keytool CLI, Sui Move CLI, and Sui Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

To get the latest version of the CLI, you can run the following command from a terminal or console. Be sure to replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with `main`, `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to get the desired version. For more information on the branches available, see [Sui Environment Setup](./contribute/sui-environment.mdx).

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features gas-profiler sui
```

:::info

The `--features gas-profiler` flag is necessary only if you want to run gas profiles for transactions.
