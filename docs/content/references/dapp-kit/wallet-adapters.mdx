Wallet adapters are a low-level concept that normalize all wallet interactions into a single API, making it possible for dapps to have consistent interactions with wallets. Wallet Kit comes pre-configured with all supported wallet adapters, so you should not need to manually install or configure these.

Here is a list of the currently-supported wallet adapters:

- `@mysten/wallet-adapter-wallet-standard` - The wallet adapter for wallets that adhere to the Wallet Standard.
- `@mysten/wallet-adapter-unsafe-burner` - A demo wallet adapter, which locally generates a random keypair. This should not be used in production.
