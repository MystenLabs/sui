While Wallet Kit is a React library, we also have a lower-level library that provides the core state management and wallet adapter interaction, which can be used in other non-React contexts. This package is published on npm as `@mysten/wallet-kit-core`.

```bash
npm install @mysten/wallet-kit-core
```

Once the package is installed, you can create an instance of WalletKitCore:

```tsx
import { createWalletKitCore } from "@mysten/wallet-kit-core";

const walletKit = createWalletKitCore();
```
