title: Move Trace Debugger
description: Debug Move execution traces directly in VS Code to understand how your code executes.
---

The Move Trace Debugger extension for Visual Studio Code provides a familiar debugging interface for Move unit tests. You can step through code execution, track local variable values, and set line breakpoints to understand how your Move code executes.

## Installing

The Move Trace Debugger extension is available in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Search for `Move Trace Debugger` in the **Extensions** view, or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and type `ext install mysten.move-trace-debug`.
You can also run `code --install-extension mysten.move-trace-debug` to install the extension from the command line.
If you installed the Move extension, you don't need to install the Move Trace Debugger extension separately, it should be installed automatically.

In order to use the debugger, you must also have the `sui` binary installed with the `tracing` feature flag enabled. The `sui` binary in release tarballs, Homebrew, and Chocolatey, have this feature enabled.
See the [Sui installation guide](../../guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx) for more information, including building from source.

## Usage

Debugging a Move unit test is a two-step process:

1. Generate execution traces:
   - Open the command palette (`⇧` + `⌘` + `P` on macOS)
   - Run the `Move: Trace Move test execution` command
   - Traces are generated in JSON format in the `traces` directory

2. Start debugging:
   - Open the Move file containing your test
   - Select `Run -> Start Debugging` from the menu
   - If the file has multiple tests, select the specific test from the dropdown menu

## Features

### Stepping through code execution

![Stepping through code execution](./images/debugger_running.png)

Move Trace Debugger supports standard debugging features like step over, step into, step out, continue, and stop. You can step through normal code, and also Move macros. 

### Tracking variable values  

Move Trace Debugger supports displaying the values of primitive types, Move structs, and references.
At present, the debugger doesn't support setting watchpoints on variables.
