title: Move Analyzer VSCode Extension
---

The Move Analyzer extension for Visual Studio Code provides language support features for the Move programming language. It enables syntax highlighting, code completion, and advanced features like go-to-definition and type checking.

## Installing

You can install the Move extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

- Open VS Code
- Open the Extensions view (`⇧` + `⌘` + `X` on macOS) 
- Search for "mysten.move"
- Click Install on the Move extension by Mysten Labs

You can also use `Ctrl-P` or `Cmd-P` and type `ext install mysten.move` to install the extension, or install via the command line: 

```bash
code --install-extension mysten.move
```

Installing the Move extension also installs the following extensions:

- [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax)
- [Move Trace Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move-trace-debug)

### Installing `move-analyzer`

The Move extension will attempt to install the appropriate `move-analyzer` binary for your platform. If this doesn't work, or you would prefer to install it manually, you can build it with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git sui-move-lsp
```
By default, the Move extension expects to find the `move-analyzer` binary in `~/.sui/bin`. You can either copy the binary here, or configure the extension to use a different path. 

## Features

### Build, Test, and Trace

The Move extension installs command palette commands for building, testing, and tracing Move code.

These commands will attempt to find the `Move.toml` file for the open Move source file and will open a terminal to run the appropriate `sui move` command.

In order to generate a trace, you will need to have a trace-capable `sui` binary. See the [Debugging](/references/ide/debugger) page for more information.

### Syntax highlighting

The [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax) extension provides syntax highlighting.

### Hover information

Hovering over identifiers will show type information and other information about the identifier. This works for all Move symbols including macros.

### Code completion

The Move extension attempts to autocomplete upon a dot operator, displaying the available methods and fields for the type.

### Definition linking

The move extension supports `go-to-definition` linking for all Move symbols including types, functions, and macros, as long as the type was present when move-analyzer last built the file.
