The Move Analyzer extension for Visual Studio Code provides language support features for the Move programming language. It enables syntax highlighting, code completion, and advanced features like definition linking and type checking.

## Installing

You can install the Move extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

- Open VS Code
- Open the Extensions view (<kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> on macOS, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> on Windows/Linux) 
- Search for `mysten.move`
- Click **Install** on the Move extension by Mysten Labs

You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and type `ext install mysten.move` to install the extension, or install via the command line: 

```bash
code --install-extension mysten.move
```

Installing the Move extension also installs the following extensions:

- [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax)
- [Move Trace Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.move-trace-debug)

### Installing `move-analyzer`

The Move extension attempts to install the appropriate `move-analyzer` binary for your platform. If this doesn't work, or you prefer to install it manually, build it with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git sui-move-lsp
```
By default, the Move extension expects to find the `move-analyzer` binary in `~/.sui/bin`. You can either copy the binary here, or configure the extension to use a different path. 

## Features

The Move extension supports most Language Server Protocol features as well as basic commands for building, testing, and tracing Move code.

### Build, Test, and Trace

The Move extension installs command palette commands for building, testing, and tracing Move code.

These commands find the `Move.toml` file for the open Move source file and open a terminal to run the appropriate `sui move` command.

To generate a trace, you need to have a trace-capable `sui` binary. See [Debugger](./debugger.mdx) for more information.

### Syntax highlighting

The [Move Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-syntax) extension provides syntax highlighting.

### Hover information

Hovering over identifiers shows type information, struct fields and attributes, and docstrings (if any) for the identifier. This works for all Move symbols including macros.

### Code completion

The Move extension autocompletes upon a dot operator, displaying the available methods and fields for the type.

The Move extension will also autocomplete in types after a `::` operator.

Finally, the Move extension will complete "inlay hints," where the plugin will automatically insert the correct type after a variable declaration, unpack, function parameters, and other places.

### Navigation

The move extension supports `go-to-definition` navigation for all Move symbols including types, functions, and macros, as long as the type was present when move-analyzer last built the file. 
It also supports `find-references` for functions, macros, constants, and types.
