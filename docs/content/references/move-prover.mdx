title: Sui Move Prover

---

The Sui Move Prover is a tool for verifying the correctness of Move smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. It is based on the Boogie verification engine and the Z3 SMT solver.

## The `prover` module

The `prover` module is a spec-only module that provides the building blocks for writing specifications.

### Function `requires`

The `requires` function is used to specify the conditions which are assumed to hold on the arguments of the function.

```move
requires(shares_in.value() <= pool.shares.supply_value());
```

### Function `ensures`

The `ensures` function is used to specify the conditions which must hold as an effect of the function call.

```move
ensures(new_shares.mul(old_balance).lte(old_shares.mul(new_balance)));
```

### Function `asserts`

The `asserts` function is used to specify conditions that must always hold.

```move
asserts(shares_in.value() <= pool.shares.supply_value());
```

### Macro `old`

The `old` macro is used to refer to the state of an object before the function call.

```move
let old_pool = old!(pool);
```

## Attributes

### `#[spec]` of a function

The `spec` attribute is used to specify that a function is a specification.

When the `spec` attribute is on a function called `<function_name>_spec`, the Move Prover will use the specification instead of the original function when verifying other functions that call `<function_name>`.

In this case the spec function must:

1. have the same name as the original function, but with `_spec` appended -- if this is not the case, the spec will only be used for checking a scenario (see below)
2. have the same signature as the original function
3. call the original function -- the value returned by the spec is usually the value returned by the original function, but this is not required

### `#[spec]` as a spec of a scenario

The `#[spec]` attribute can be used to specify a scenario that can be checked by the Move Prover. In this case there are no restrictions on the name and signature of the spec function.

### `#[spec(verify)]`

The `#[spec(verify)]` attribute is used to specify that a function is a specification that should be verified by the Move Prover.
We envision using other attributes in the future to indicate other ways of checking a scenario, like fuzzing.
