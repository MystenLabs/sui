This section provides sample manifest files for you to use as templates in your project.

For a basic project that only depends on `sui` and `std`, the minimal lockfile is:

```toml
[package]
name = "example"
```

For a package that has a `mvr` dependency and a git dependency with different Mainnet and Testnet branches:

<!-- TODO: usdc doesn't actually have different tags; find a package that does -->

```toml
[package]
name = "example"

[dependencies]
ascii = { r.mvr = "@potatoes/ascii" }
usdc = { git = "https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-sui.git", subdir = "packages/usdc", rev = "releases/testnet" }

[dep-replacements.mainnet]
usdc = { git = "https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-sui.git", subdir = "packages/usdc", rev = "releases/mainnet" }
```

For a package that defines a `testnet_alpha` environment:

```toml
[package]
name = "example"

[environments]
testnet_alpha = "4c78adac"

[dependencies]
ascii = { r.mvr = "@potatoes/ascii" }
usdc = { git = "https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-sui.git", subdir = "packages/usdc", rev = "releases/testnet" }

[dep-replacements.mainnet]
usdc = { git = "https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-sui.git", subdir = "packages/usdc", rev = "releases/testnet" }

[dep-replacements.testnet_alpha]
ascii = { use-environment = "ascii" }
usdc = { use-environment = "testnet" }
```
