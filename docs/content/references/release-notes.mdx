### Protocol

#### Sui v1.62 Gas Schedule Updates (and what to expect)

Sui v1.62 includes targeted gas schedule and metering fixes to more accurately account for the true execution cost and introduce a few new gas changes to reduce over-charging.

##### Summary of gas schedule changes

**Dynamic field changes (largest behavioral impact)**

Dynamic field operations now charge differently depending on cache status:

- **First load of a dynamic field** (i.e., not in the runtime cache, and not created in the transaction) is **more expensive**.
- **Subsequent loads of the same dynamic field within the transaction** are **significantly cheaper**.
- **Accessing dynamic fields created earlier in the same transaction** are  **significantly cheaper.**

**Additional execution-level adjustments**

The following execution-level adjustments are being introduced:

- **`MoveLoc` is cheaper:** We previously (incorrectly) charged proportionally to value size, even though no value is created. We now charge a constant amount.
- **`ReadRef` is slightly more expensive:** This creates value copies, which we now account for.
- **Execution stack tracking:** More accurate stack-height metering reduces over-charging for some instructions.
- **Primitive size accounting tuning:** The computed “size” for several primitive types now better match their actual size, including some decreases and increases.

##### Observed impact from transaction sampling

We backtested several million transactions when examining these gas changes. Across a few million sampled transactions:

- **5.7%** saw a change in gas usage. Of that:
    - **1.3%** saw a gas **increase**
    - **4.4%** saw a gas **decrease**
- The **mean** change in gas costs across all transactions was **−6.03%**
- The **median** change in gas costs was **−21.52%**

Looking at the distribution among affected transactions:

- Up through about the **75th percentile**, changes are **net decreases** in gas costs.
- From the **76th percentile onward**, changes shift to **increases**.
- Extremes (0th/100th percentile) show larger swings, mostly explained by dynamic-field behavior interacting with size/caching.

##### What this means for developers

For most workloads, you will notice no change (only 5.7% are affected from several million transactions). If you do, it is more likely to be a cost decrease.

##### Costly patterns

Your transactions may be more expensive if they do **some or all** of the following:

- Read **many unique dynamic fields**
- The fields read are **large in size**
- Each field is read only a few times per transaction

This is because **first-time loads of uncached dynamic fields** are now **more expensive**.

##### Cheaper transactions

Your transactions should get cheaper if they do **any** of the following:

- Read **a small set of dynamic fields repeatedly** within the same transaction
- **Create dynamic fields** and then access them again in-transaction

These now benefit from the cache-aware and “created in-transaction” discounts.

##### Secondary effects

Most other instruction and stack-metering changes are modest, paving a path toward optimization in compilation. Over time, compiler work to prefer moving locals over copies wherever possible should allow the compiler to be able to take advantage of the reduced cost for `MoveLoc` that is introduced in these changes.


### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)
[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

### JSON-RPC

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [[#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192)]([#2419](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/2419)2), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass
watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting
from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its
starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all
pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,
`--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have
a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the
configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume
processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same
pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two
new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.
These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint
data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of
their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently
these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks
per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:  
1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for _initial_ ingestion of a
fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and
optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can
achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a
configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential
pipelines.

### GraphQL

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

[#23928](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23928): Removed `events` field from `SimulationResult`. Events are now only accessible via `effects.events()` to eliminate redundancy.

[#23929](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23929): Returns `null` for simulated/executed transactions timestamp as they are not included in a checkpoint.

[#24486](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24486): Validate types and fields passed into AvailableRange queries.

### CLI

[#24367](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24367):
- Refactored `sui validator` commands to use a shared
[TxProcessingArgs](cci:2://file:///Users/jnaulty/github/mystenlabs/sui/crates/sui/src/client_commands.rs:693:0-721:1)
struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui
client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide
clearer instructions for offline signing.

[#21896](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21896): Implements the wait_for_effects gRPC API on validators to support the second query for mysticeti-fastpath that is waiting for effects on a validator. A status cache is introduced to remember the current consensus status for each consensus position (instead of the transaction digest). When waiting for effects, acquire the first status update to ensure that it is not rejected by consensus, then wait for effects while making sure it is not eventually rejected post-commit. In the new request, use a single boolean include_details to indicate whether to get all detailed data, including effects itself, instead of using individual booleans.


[#22197](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22197): Enables TLS on connections to validators over the gRPC interface.

[#20346](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20346): Fix a bug when reading a dynamic object field value from an `Owner`, where the value returned would not be the latest version when the `owner` was queried without a root/parent version supplied.

[#20340](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20340): `Checkpoint` has now a `bcs` field that represents the Base64 encoded BCS serialization of the `CheckpointSummary` data.

[#20523](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20523): graphql changes to enable pruning, mainly around watermark

### CLI

[#20354](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20354): Fixed the `sui validator display-metadata` command bug for pending validators.

[#20395](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20395): When issuing `sui move new` command, a `.gitignore` file will be added to the project's folder.

[#20426](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20426): I added a warning when trying to publish/upgrade a package if the CLI falls behind more than two protocol versions than the network on which the package is about to be published/upgraded.

[#20474](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20474): Support fully overriding the config directory during `sui start`.

[#20472](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20472): Added the `--data-ingestion-dir` option to `sui start` to set a custom directory where to write the checkpoint files.

[#20475](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20475): Added the flag `--ignore-chain` that works together with `sui move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64` to bypass the need for a `client.yaml` file. This allows building to proceed without a network connection or active environment, but it will not be able to automatically determine the addresses of its dependencies. NB: `--ignore-chain` depends on `--dump-bytecode-as-base64`, so it cannot be used on its own.

[#17115](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/17115): Move will now lint against certain binary operations where the operands are identical, non-value expressions.

[#20498](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20498): Compiler may generate slightly different errors as a result of the compilation process being more permissive with respect to parsing errors

[#20511](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20511): Added the `--committee-size` argument to `sui start` and `sui genesis` to configure the number of validators to start with the local network / when generating a genesis.

[#16479](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/16479): Move will now lint against pairs of comparison operations that can be combined to a single comparison.

## devnet-v1.62.0

*Source: [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-v1.62.0)*


### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)
[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

### JSON-RPC

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [[#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192)]([#2419](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/2419)2), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass
watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting
from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its
starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all
pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,
`--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have
a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the
configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume
processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same
pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two
new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.
These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint
data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of
their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently
these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks
per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:  
1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for _initial_ ingestion of a
fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and
optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can
achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a
configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential
pipelines.

### GraphQL

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

[#23928](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23928): Removed `events` field from `SimulationResult`. Events are now only accessible via `effects.events()` to eliminate redundancy.

[#23929](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23929): Returns `null` for simulated/executed transactions timestamp as they are not included in a checkpoint.

[#24486](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24486): Validate types and fields passed into AvailableRange queries.

### CLI

[#24367](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24367):
- Refactored `sui validator` commands to use a shared
[TxProcessingArgs](cci:2://file:///Users/jnaulty/github/mystenlabs/sui/crates/sui/src/client_commands.rs:693:0-721:1)
struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui
client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide
clearer instructions for offline signing.

[#21877](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21877):
TLS now required to connect to validator gRPC interface.

### CLI

[#22332](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22332):
Update test names used for filtering in Move unit tests so
the fully-qualified name is used to match against (i.e.,
`testing::a::test_name` instead of `a::test_name`). Also add support for
regexes to be used for test filtering rather than just substring
matching.

[#22303](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22303):
Update the package summary generation to make them more
portable.

[#22350](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22350):

## devnet-v1.50.0

*Source: [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-v1.50.0)*


### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `85`

[#22173](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22173): Allow larger objects to be created by system transactions

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)

[#22143](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22143): DoS protection is enabled in dryRun mode by default for validators

### gRPC

[#21896](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21896): Implements the wait_for_effects gRPC API on validators to support the second query for mysticeti-fastpath that is waiting for effects on a validator. A status cache is introduced to remember the current consensus status for each consensus position (instead of transaction digest). When waiting for effects, acquire the first status update to ensure that it is not rejected by consensus, then wait for effects while making sure it is not eventually rejected post-commit. In the new request, use a single boolean include_details to indicate whether to get all detailed data, including effects itself, instead of using individual booleans.

[#22197](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22197): Enables TLS on connections to validators over the gRPC interface.

### JSON-RPC

[#21932](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21932): returns additional error information when an abort error occurs.

### CLI

[#22166](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22166): Added the `-c` short flag for the `sui client upgrade` command to pass the upgrade capability.

[#22139](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22139): Add default TLS to sui-tool with optional --no-tls flag

[#22293](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22293): Added a new `--sender` argument for transactions to set the sender to a specific address.

## testnet-v1.62.0

*Sources: Local release notes and [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/testnet-v1.62.0)*

### Protocol

#### Sui v1.62 Gas Schedule Updates (and what to expect)

Sui v1.62 includes targeted gas schedule and metering fixes to more accurately account for the true execution cost and introduce a few new gas changes to reduce over-charging.

##### Summary of gas schedule changes

**Dynamic field changes (largest behavioral impact)**

Dynamic field operations now charge differently depending on cache status:

- **First load of a dynamic field** (i.e., not in the runtime cache, and not created in the transaction) is **more expensive**.
- **Subsequent loads of the same dynamic field within the transaction** are **significantly cheaper**.
- **Accessing dynamic fields created earlier in the same transaction** are  **significantly cheaper.**

**Additional execution-level adjustments**

The following execution-level adjustments are being introduced:

- **`MoveLoc` is cheaper:** We previously (incorrectly) charged proportionally to value size, even though no value is created. We now charge a constant amount.
- **`ReadRef` is slightly more expensive:** This creates value copies, which we now account for.
- **Execution stack tracking:** More accurate stack-height metering reduces over-charging for some instructions.
- **Primitive size accounting tuning:** The computed “size” for several primitive types now better match their actual size, including some decreases and increases.

##### Observed impact from transaction sampling

We backtested several million transactions when examining these gas changes. Across a few million sampled transactions:

- **5.7%** saw a change in gas usage. Of that:
    - **1.3%** saw a gas **increase**
    - **4.4%** saw a gas **decrease**
- The **mean** change in gas costs across all transactions was **−6.03%**
- The **median** change in gas costs was **−21.52%**

Looking at the distribution among affected transactions:

- Up through about the **75th percentile**, changes are **net decreases** in gas costs.
- From the **76th percentile onward**, changes shift to **increases**.
- Extremes (0th/100th percentile) show larger swings, mostly explained by dynamic-field behavior interacting with size/caching.

##### What this means for developers

For most workloads, you will notice no change (only 5.7% are affected from several million transactions). If you do, it is more likely to be a cost decrease.

##### Costly patterns

Your transactions may be more expensive if they do **some or all** of the following:

- Read **many unique dynamic fields**
- The fields read are **large in size**
- Each field is read only a few times per transaction

This is because **first-time loads of uncached dynamic fields** are now **more expensive**.

##### Cheaper transactions

Your transactions should get cheaper if they do **any** of the following:

- Read **a small set of dynamic fields repeatedly** within the same transaction
- **Create dynamic fields** and then access them again in-transaction

These now benefit from the cache-aware and “created in-transaction” discounts.

##### Secondary effects

Most other instruction and stack-metering changes are modest, paving a path toward optimization in compilation. Over time, compiler work to prefer moving locals over copies wherever possible should allow the compiler to be able to take advantage of the reduced cost for `MoveLoc` that is introduced in these changes.


### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)
[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

### JSON-RPC

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [[#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192)]([#2419](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/2419)2), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass
watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting
from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its
starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all
pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,
`--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have
a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the
configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume
processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same
pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two
new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.
These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint
data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of
their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently
these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks
per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:  
1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for _initial_ ingestion of a
fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and
optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can
achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a
configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential
pipelines.

### GraphQL

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

[#23928](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23928): Removed `events` field from `SimulationResult`. Events are now only accessible via `effects.events()` to eliminate redundancy.

[#23929](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23929): Returns `null` for simulated/executed transactions timestamp as they are not included in a checkpoint.

[#24486](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24486): Validate types and fields passed into AvailableRange queries.

### CLI

[#24367](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24367):
- Refactored `sui validator` commands to use a shared
[TxProcessingArgs](cci:2://file:///Users/jnaulty/github/mystenlabs/sui/crates/sui/src/client_commands.rs:693:0-721:1)
struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui
client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide
clearer instructions for offline signing.

[#22353](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22353): Congestion control settings have been adjusted

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)

[#22143](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22143): DoS protection is enabled in dryRun mode by default for validators

### gRPC

[#21896](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21896): Implements the wait_for_effects gRPC API on validators to support the second query for mysticeti-fastpath that is waiting for effects on a validator. A status cache is introduced to remember the current consensus status for each consensus position (instead of the transaction digest). When waiting for effects, acquire the first status update to ensure that it is not rejected by consensus, then wait for effects while making sure it is not eventually rejected post-commit. In the new request, use a single boolean include_details to indicate whether to get all detailed data, including effects itself, instead of using individual booleans.


[#22197](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22197): Enables TLS on connections to validators over the gRPC interface.

### JSON-RPC

[#21932](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21932): returns additional error information when an abort error occurs.

### CLI

[#22166](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22166): Added the `-c` short flag for the `sui client upgrade` command to pass the upgrade capability.

[#22139](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22139): Add default TLS to sui-tool with optional --no-tls flag

## devnet-v1.62.0

*Source: [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-v1.62.0)*


### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)
[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

### JSON-RPC

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [[#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192)]([#2419](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/2419)2), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass
watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting
from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its
starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all
pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,
`--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have
a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the
configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume
processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same
pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two
new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.
These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint
data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of
their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently
these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks
per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:  
1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for _initial_ ingestion of a
fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and
optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can
achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a
configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential
pipelines.

### GraphQL

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

[#23928](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23928): Removed `events` field from `SimulationResult`. Events are now only accessible via `effects.events()` to eliminate redundancy.

[#23929](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23929): Returns `null` for simulated/executed transactions timestamp as they are not included in a checkpoint.

[#24486](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24486): Validate types and fields passed into AvailableRange queries.

### CLI

[#24367](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24367):
- Refactored `sui validator` commands to use a shared
[TxProcessingArgs](cci:2://file:///Users/jnaulty/github/mystenlabs/sui/crates/sui/src/client_commands.rs:693:0-721:1)
struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui
client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide
clearer instructions for offline signing.

### gRPC

[#21896](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21896): Implements the wait_for_effects gRPC API on validators to support the second query for mysticeti-fastpath that is waiting for effects on a validator. A status cache is introduced to remember the current consensus status for each consensus position (instead of transaction digest). When waiting for effects, acquire the first status update to ensure that it is not rejected by consensus, then wait for effects while making sure it is not eventually rejected post-commit. In the new request, use a single boolean include_details to indicate whether to get all detailed data, including effects itself, instead of using individual booleans.

[#22197](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22197): Enables TLS on connections to validators over the gRPC interface.
