title: JSON-RPC API Format
---

_SuiJSON_ is a JSON-based format with restrictions that allow Sui to align JSON inputs more closely with Move call arguments.

This table shows the restrictions placed on JSON types to make them SuiJSON compatible:

| JSON    | SuiJSON Restrictions                         | Move Type Mapping                                                                        |

| Number  | Must be unsigned integer                     | u8, u6, u32, u64 (encoded as String), u128 (encoded as String), u256 (encoded as String) |
| String  | No restrictions                              | Vector`<u8>`, Address, ObjectID, TypeTag, Identifier, Unsigned integer (256 bit max)     |

## Type coercion reasoning {#type-coercion-reasoning}

Due to the loosely typed nature of JSON/SuiJSON and the strongly typed nature of Move types, you sometimes need to overload SuiJSON types to represent multiple Move types.

For example `SuiJSON::Number` can represent both _u8_ and _u32_. This means you have to coerce and sometimes convert types.

Which type you coerce depends on the expected Move type. For example, if the Move function expects a u8, you must have received a `SuiJSON::Number` with a value less than 256. More importantly, you have no way to easily express Move addresses in JSON, so you encode them as hex strings prefixed by `0x`.

Additionally, Move supports u128 and u256 but JSON doesn't. As a result Sui allows encoding numbers as strings.
