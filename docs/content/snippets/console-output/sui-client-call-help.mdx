Call Move function

Usage: sui client call [OPTIONS] --package <PACKAGE> --module <MODULE> --function <FUNCTION>

Options:
      --package <PACKAGE>
          Object ID of the package, which contains the module

      --module <MODULE>
          The name of the module in the package

      --function <FUNCTION>
          Function name in module

      --type-args <TYPE_ARGS>...
          Type arguments to the generic function being called. All must be specified, or the call
          will fail

      --args <ARGS>...
          Simplified ordered args like in the function syntax ObjectIDs, Addresses must be hex
          strings

      --gas <GAS>...
          IDs of gas objects to be used for gas payment. If none are provided, coins are selected
          automatically to cover the gas budget

      --gas-budget <GAS_BUDGET>
          An optional gas budget for this transaction (in MIST). If gas budget is not provided, the
          tool will first perform a dry run to estimate the gas cost, and then it will execute the
          transaction. Please note that this incurs a small cost in performance due to the
          additional dry run call

      --gas-price <GAS_PRICE>
          An optional gas price for this transaction (in MIST). If gas price is not provided, the
          tool will use the current reference gas price from RPC.
          
          Transactions with a gas price lower than the reference will not be signed by enough
          validators to execute. Transactions accessing congested shared objects are prioritized by
          gas price, so setting a higher gas price higher than the reference can ensure the
          transaction accesses the shared object sooner.

      --gas-sponsor <GAS_SPONSOR>
          An optional field to specify a gas sponsor address. If provided, the gas owner is set to
          this address, rather than the transaction's sender.
          
          Note that if the CLI does not have access to the sponsor's keys, it will not be able to
          sign and execute transactions that have a sponsor set.

      --tx-digest
          Compute the transaction digest and print it out, but do not execute the transaction

      --dry-run
          Perform a dry run of the transaction, without executing it

      --dev-inspect
          Perform a dev inspect

      --serialize-unsigned-transaction
          Instead of executing the transaction, serialize the bcs bytes of the unsigned transaction
          data (TransactionData) using base64 encoding, and print out the string <TX_BYTES>. The
          string can be used to execute transaction with `sui client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes
          <TX_BYTES>`

      --serialize-signed-transaction
          Instead of executing the transaction, serialize the bcs bytes of the signed transaction
          data (SenderSignedData) using base64 encoding, and print out the string <SIGNED_TX_BYTES>.
          The string can be used to execute transaction with `sui client execute-combined-signed-tx
          --signed-tx-bytes <SIGNED_TX_BYTES>`

      --sender <SENDER>
          Set the transaction sender to this address. When not specified, the sender is inferred by
          finding the owner of the gas payment. Note that when setting this field, the transaction
          will fail to execute if the sender's private key is not in the keystore; similarly, it
          will fail when using this with `--serialize-signed-transaction` flag if the private key
          corresponding to this address is not in keystore

      --json
          Return command outputs in json format

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
