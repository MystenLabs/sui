  addresses                   Obtain the Addresses managed by the client
  balance                     List the coin balance of an address
  call                        Call Move function

                                  be used instead of the address

                                  m/44'/784'/0'/0'/0' for ed25519 or m/54'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256k1
                                  or m/74'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256r1. Word length can be { word12 |
                                  word15 | word18 | word21 | word24} default to word12 if not

  new-env                     Add new Sui environment
  object                      Get object info
  objects                     Obtain all objects owned by the address. It also accepts an

  pay-all-sui                 Pay all residual SUI coins to the recipient with input coins,
                                  after deducting the gas cost. The input coins also include the

  pay-sui                     Pay SUI coins to recipients following following specified amounts,
                                  with input coins. Length of recipients must be the same as that of
                                  amounts. The input coins also include the coin for gas payment, so
                                  no extra gas coin is required
