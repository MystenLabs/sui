Sui keystore tool

Usage: sui keytool [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  update-alias
          Update an old alias to a new one. If a new alias is not provided, a random one will be
          generated
  convert
          Convert private key in Hex or Base64 to new format (Bech32 encoded 33 byte flag || private
          key starting with "suiprivkey"). Hex private key format import and export are both
          deprecated in Sui Wallet and Sui CLI Keystore. Use `sui keytool import` if you wish to
          import a key to Sui Keystore
  decode-or-verify-tx
          Given a Base64 encoded transaction bytes, decode its components. If a signature is
          provided, verify the signature against the transaction and output the result
  decode-multi-sig
          Given a Base64 encoded MultiSig signature, decode its components. If tx_bytes is passed
          in, verify the multisig
  generate
          Generate a new keypair with key scheme flag {ed25519 | secp256k1 | secp256r1} with
          optional derivation path, default to m/44'/784'/0'/0'/0' for ed25519 or m/54'/784'/0'/0/0
          for secp256k1 or m/74'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256r1. Word length can be { word12 | word15 |
          word18 | word21 | word24} default to word12 if not specified
  import
          Add a new key to Sui CLI Keystore using either the input mnemonic phrase or a Bech32
          encoded 33-byte `flag || privkey` starting with "suiprivkey", the key scheme flag {ed25519
          | secp256k1 | secp256r1} and an optional derivation path, default to m/44'/784'/0'/0'/0'
          for ed25519 or m/54'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256k1 or m/74'/784'/0'/0/0 for secp256r1.
          Supports mnemonic phrase of word length 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. Set an alias for the key with
          the --alias flag. If no alias is provided, the tool will automatically generate one
  export
          Output the private key of the given key identity in Sui CLI Keystore as Bech32 encoded
          string starting with `suiprivkey`
  list
          List all keys by its Sui address, Base64 encoded public key, key scheme name in
          sui.keystore
  load-keypair
          This reads the content at the provided file path. The accepted format can be [enum
          SuiKeyPair] (Base64 encoded of 33-byte `flag || privkey`) or `type AuthorityKeyPair`
          (Base64 encoded `privkey`). This prints out the account keypair as Base64 encoded `flag ||
          privkey`, the network keypair, worker keypair, protocol keypair as Base64 encoded
          `privkey`
  multi-sig-address
          To MultiSig Sui Address. Pass in a list of all public keys `flag || pk` in Base64. See
          `keytool list` for example public keys
  multi-sig-combine-partial-sig
          Provides a list of participating signatures (`flag || sig || pk` encoded in Base64),
          threshold, a list of all public keys and a list of their weights that define the MultiSig
          address. Returns a valid MultiSig signature and its sender address. The result can be used
          as signature field for `sui client execute-signed-tx`. The sum of weights of all
          signatures must be >= the threshold
  multi-sig-combine-partial-sig-legacy
          
  show
          Read the content at the provided file path. The accepted format can be [enum SuiKeyPair]
          (Base64 encoded of 33-byte `flag || privkey`) or `type AuthorityKeyPair` (Base64 encoded
          `privkey`). It prints its Base64 encoded public key and the key scheme flag
  sign
          Create signature using the private key for the given address (or its alias) in sui
          keystore. Any signature commits to a [struct IntentMessage] consisting of the Base64
          encoded of the BCS serialized transaction bytes itself and its intent. If intent is
          absent, default will be used
  sign-kms
          Creates a signature by leveraging AWS KMS. Pass in a key-id to leverage Amazon KMS to sign
          a message and the base64 pubkey. Generate PubKey from pem using MystenLabs/base64pemkey
          Any signature commits to a [struct IntentMessage] consisting of the Base64 encoded of the
          BCS serialized transaction bytes itself and its intent. If intent is absent, default will
          be used
  unpack
          This takes [enum SuiKeyPair] of Base64 encoded of 33-byte `flag || privkey`). It outputs
          the keypair into a file at the current directory where the address is the filename, and
          prints out its Sui address, Base64 encoded public key, the key scheme, and the key scheme
          flag
  zk-login-sign-and-execute-tx
          Given the max_epoch, generate an OAuth url, ask user to paste the redirect with id_token,
          call salt server, then call the prover server, create a test transaction, use the
          ephemeral key to sign and execute it by assembling to a serialized zkLogin signature
  zk-login-enter-token
          A workaround to the above command because sometimes token pasting does not work (for
          Facebook). All the inputs required here are printed from the command above
  zk-login-sig-verify
          Given a zkLogin signature, parse it if valid. If `bytes` provided, parse it as either as
          TransactionData or PersonalMessage based on `intent_scope`. It verifies the zkLogin
          signature based its latest JWK fetched. Example request: sui keytool zk-login-sig-verify
          --sig $SERIALIZED_ZKLOGIN_SIG --bytes $BYTES --intent-scope 0 --network devnet
          --curr-epoch 10
  zk-login-insecure-sign-personal-message
          TESTING ONLY: Generate a fixed ephemeral key and its JWT token with test issuer. Produce a
          zklogin signature for the given data and max epoch. e.g. sui keytool
          zk-login-insecure-sign-personal-message --data "hello" --max-epoch 5
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
