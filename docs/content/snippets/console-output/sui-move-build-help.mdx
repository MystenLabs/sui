```sh
Usage: sui move build [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --path <PACKAGE_PATH>
          Path to a package which the command should be run with respect to
      --with-unpublished-dependencies
          Include the contents of packages in dependencies that haven't been published (only
          relevant when dumping bytecode as base64)
      --dump-bytecode-as-base64
          Whether we are printing in base64
      --ignore-chain
          [Mainly for testing, not recommended for production] Don't specialize the package to the
          active chain when dumping bytecode as Base64. This allows building to proceed without a
          network connection or active environment, but it will not be able to automatically
          determine the addresses of its dependencies
  -d, --dev
          Compile in 'dev' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used if
          this flag is set. This flag is useful for development of packages that expose named
          addresses that are not set to a specific value
      --generate-struct-layouts
          If true, generate struct layout schemas for all struct types passed into `entry` functions
          declared by modules in this package These layout schemas can be consumed by clients (e.g.,
          the TypeScript SDK) to enable serialization/deserialization of transaction arguments and
          events
      --test
          Compile in 'test' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used
          along with any code in the 'tests' directory
      --doc
          Generate documentation for packages
      --disassemble
          Save disassembly for generated bytecode along with bytecode maps (source maps for
          disassembeld bytecode)
      --install-dir <INSTALL_DIR>
          Installation directory for compiled artifacts. Defaults to current directory
      --force
          Force recompilation of all packages
      --fetch-deps-only
          Only fetch dependency repos to MOVE_HOME
      --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
          Skip fetching latest git dependencies
      --default-move-flavor <DEFAULT_FLAVOR>
          Default flavor for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config
      --default-move-edition <DEFAULT_EDITION>
          Default edition for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config
      --dependencies-are-root
          If set, dependency packages are treated as root packages. Notably, this will remove
          warning suppression in dependency packages
      --silence-warnings
          If set, ignore any compiler warnings
      --warnings-are-errors
          If set, warnings become errors
      --json-errors
          If set, reports errors at JSON
      --no-lint
          If `true`, disable linters
      --lint
          If `true`, enables extra linters
      --mode <MODE>
          Arbitrary mode -- this will be used to enable or filter user-defined `#[mode(<MODE>)]`
          annodations during compiltaion
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```
