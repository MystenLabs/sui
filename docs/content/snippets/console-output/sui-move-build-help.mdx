```sh
Usage: sui move build [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --path <PACKAGE_PATH>
          Path to a package which the command should be run with respect to
      --with-unpublished-dependencies
          Include the contents of packages in dependencies that haven't been published (only
          relevant when dumping bytecode as base64)
      --dump-bytecode-as-base64
          Dump the compiled bytecode as base64-encoded strings in a JSON object, together with the
          digest and list of dependencies
      --no-tree-shaking
          By default, the CLI will drop any unused dependencies from the output and makes calls to
          the RPC. This flag disables that behavior and avoids any RPC calls, keeping all
          dependencies in the output (the dependency list). This is useful for offline compilation.
          Only to be used with `--dump-bytecode-as-base64`
      --generate-struct-layouts
          If true, generate struct layout schemas for all struct types passed into `entry` functions
          declared by modules in this package These layout schemas can be consumed by clients (e.g.,
          the TypeScript SDK) to enable serialization/deserialization of transaction arguments and
          events
      --test
          Compile in 'test' mode and include the code in the 'tests' directory
      --doc
          Generate documentation for packages
      --disassemble
          Save disassembly for generated bytecode along with bytecode maps (source maps for
          disassembled bytecode)
      --install-dir <INSTALL_DIR>
          Installation directory for compiled artifacts. Defaults to current directory
      --force
          Force recompilation of all packages
      --allow-dirty
          Allow building, even if some cached git dependencies in `~/.move` are modified
      --default-move-flavor <DEFAULT_FLAVOR>
          Default flavor for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config
      --default-move-edition <DEFAULT_EDITION>
          Default edition for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config
      --silence-warnings
          If set, ignore any compiler warnings
  -q, --quiet
          Display less output
      --warnings-are-errors
          If set, warnings become errors
      --json-errors
          If set, reports errors at JSON
      --no-lint
          If `true`, disable linters
      --lint
          If `true`, enables extra linters
      --mode <MODE>
          Arbitrary mode -- this will be used to enable or filter user-defined `#[mode(<MODE>)]`
          annotations during compilation
  -e, --environment <ENVIRONMENT>
          Environment to use for building packages
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```
