- Concurrent processing: Multiple tasks running concurrently for maximum throughput.

Primary responsibility: Converts raw checkpoint data into database-ready rows using parallel workers.

How it works

- Spawns `FANOUT` worker tasks (default: 10) for parallel processing
{@inject: crates/sui-indexer-alt-framework/src/pipeline/processor.rs#variable=FANOUT}
    
- Each worker calls your `Handler::process()` method independently
{@inject: crates/sui-indexer-alt-framework/src/pipeline/processor.rs#variable=values}

    
- Workers can process different checkpoints simultaneously (out-of-order)
- Sends processed data to `Collector` with checkpoint metadata

Key Configuration: `FANOUT` - controls parallel processing capacity.
