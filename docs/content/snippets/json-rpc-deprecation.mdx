**JSON-RPC is deprecated**. Migrate to either [gRPC](/concepts/grpc-overview.mdx) or [GraphQL RPC](/concepts/graphql-indexer.mdx) by April 2026.

Refer to the [list of RPC or data providers](https://www.notion.so/mystenlabs/RPC-providers-offering-future-Sui-data-primitives-2466d9dcb4e980a99a36e9aafd8c17e0?source=copy_link) that have enabled gRPC on their full nodes or offer GraphQL RPC. Contact a provider directly to request access. If your RPC or data provider doesnâ€™t yet support these data access methods, ask them to enable support or contact the Sui Foundation team on Discord, Telegram, or Slack for help.
