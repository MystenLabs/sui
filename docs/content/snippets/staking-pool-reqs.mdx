### Validator staking pool requirements 

There are minimum staking requirements a validator must satisfy to become active and to stay in the active validator set.

#### Stake Requirements

The Sui network is rolling out [SIP-39](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-39.md), which will significantly lower the barrier to entry for validators. Instead of requiring a minimum amount of SUI tokens, validators will need a minimum amount of *voting power*.

When fully rolled out, SIP-39 will mean the following validator requirements:

- A validator candidate must accrue at least 3 voting power before they can request to join the validator set.
- If an active validator's stake falls below 2 voting power, they have seven epochs of grace period to gain back the stake before being removed from the validator set.
- If an active validator's stake falls below 1 voting power, they are removed from the validator set at the end of the current epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs.

For more information on voting power, see [Understanding the voting power formula](/concepts/tokenomics.mdx#understanding-the-voting-power-formula).
