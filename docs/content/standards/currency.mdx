:::danger

The Coin and Currency standards are both used to create fungible tokens, however, they use different creation methods and store metadata in a different type of object. 

Coin creates tokens using `coin::create_currency` while Currency uses `sui::coin_registry`

Coin uses `CoinMetadata` while Currency uses `Currency`. 

The documentation refers to fungible tokens created on Sui using the Coin or Currency standard as _coins_. For fungible tokens created on Sui using the [Closed-Loop Token standard](/standards/closed-loop-token.mdx), the documentation uses the term _tokens_. In practice, the terms for both these objects are often interchangeable.

:::

The Currency Standard is a technical standard used by Move smart contracts for creating currency on Sui. The `sui::coin_registry` module provides the logic that defines the standard, providing unified metadata, enhanced supply tracking, and improved regulatory features.

The standardization of currency creation on Sui means that wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts can manage currency created on Sui the same as they manage SUI, without any additional processing logic.

See [Sui Tokenomics](/concepts/tokenomics.mdx) to learn more about the SUI native currency and its use on the network.

Currency on Sui can offer specialized abilities while following the Currency Standard. For example, you can create regulated currency that allows its creator to add specific addresses to a deny list, so that the identified addresses cannot use the currency as inputs to transactions.

## Fungible tokens

The `Currency<T>` type represents open-loop fungible tokens (see `Token<T>` for closed-loop tokens). Currencies are denominated by their type parameter, `T`, which is also associated with metadata (like name, symbol, decimal precision, and so on) that applies to all instances of `Currency<T>`. The `sui::coin_registry` module exposes an interface over `Currency<T>` that treats it as fungible, meaning that a unit of `T` held in one instance of `Currency<T>` is interchangeable with any other unit of `T`, much like how traditional fiat currencies operate.


## Currency creation

The Coin Registry is a centralized system that provides unified currency management through the `sui::coin_registry` module.

:::info

The registry is a system-level shared object located at address `0xc`.

</details>

#### Core components

**`CoinRegistry`:** The main system object that coordinates all currency-related operations. This shared object serves as the entry point for all registry operations and is created once during network initialization. It's address is `0xc`.

**`Currency<T>`:** The core of the registry system, storing comprehensive information about each coin type including:
- **Metadata management:** Basic currency information like name, symbol, decimals, description, and icon URL.
- **Supply tracking:** Maintains supply state information (fixed, burn-only, or unknown).
- **Regulatory status:** Tracks whether the coin is regulated with deny list capabilities.
- **Capability references:** Links to `TreasuryCap`s and `MetadataCap`s for the coin type.
- **Extensibility:** Includes extra fields for future enhancements.

#### Supply states

The registry supports three different supply management models:

- **Fixed supply:** The total supply is permanently locked and cannot be changed.
- **Burn-only supply:** New coins cannot be minted, but existing coins can be burned.
- **Uncontrolled supply:** `TreasuryCap` holder controls minting and burning.

#### Regulatory states

Currencies can have different regulatory states:

- **Regulated:** The currency has an associated `DenyCapV2` that can restrict addresses from using it.
- **Unregulated:** The currency was created without any deny list capabilities.
- **Unknown:** Regulatory status is undetermined, typically from legacy migrations.

#### Creation options

The registry supports two different currency creation flows:

- **Standard creation (recommended):**

    Use the `new_currency` function at any time after the currency type is published. The function immediately creates a shared `Currency<T>` object. The type `T` must be a key-only type, as in `public struct MyCoin has key { id: UID }`.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="new_currency" signatureOnly noComments />

- **One-Time Witness (OTW) creation:**

    :::caution

    OTW creation of a new currency is a two-step process. The initialization process begins with package publication. Then, a call to `finalize_registration` is needed to place the currency into the registry.

    :::

    The `new_currency_with_otw` function uses an OTW for uniqueness proof. See [One-Time Witness](https://move-book.com/programmability/one-time-witness) in The Move Book for more information.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="new_currency_with_otw" signatureOnly noComments />

#### Currency initialization

Both creation methods return a `CurrencyInitializer<T>` that allows for additional configuration:

- **Make regulated:** Add deny list capabilities.
- **Set supply model:** Choose between fixed, burn-only, or flexible supply.
- **Add extensions:** Include additional fields for custom functionality.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" struct="CurrencyInitializer" />

#### Currency finalization

A currency is not complete until after you call the `finalize` function. The function returns the `MetadataCap<T>` for metadata management. If you used an OTW to create the currency, the function sends the currency to the coin registry; otherwise, it creates the final shared `Currency<T>` object.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="finalize" signatureOnly />

If you publish a package that uses an OTW to create a currency in the package `init` function, then a call must be made to `finalize_registration` after initialization. The function transforms the currency into a shared object.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="finalize_registration" signatureOnly />


## `TreasuryCap`

When you create a currency using the `coin_registry::new_currency` or `coin_registry::new_currency_with_otw` functions, the publisher of the smart contract that creates the coin receives a `TreasuryCap` object upon finalization of the currency. The `TreasuryCap` object is required to mint new currency coins or to burn current ones (depending on currency supply state). Consequently, only addresses that have access to this object are able to maintain the currency supply on the Sui network.

The `TreasuryCap` object is transferable, so a third party can take over the management of a currency that you create if you transfer the `TreasuryCap` to them. After transferring the object, you are no longer able to mint and burn coins yourself.


## Regulated currency

The Currency Standard supports creating regulated coins. Use the `make_regulated` function during the initialization phase before calling `finalize`. The function adds deny list capabilities to the `Currency<T>` and tracks the regulatory status within the Coin Registry. The function returns a `DenyCap` that allows the bearer to maintain the list of addresses on the deny list.

</summary>
<ImportContent source="examples/move/coin/sources/regcoin_new.move" mode="code" />
</details>

### `DenyList` object

A `DenyList` shared object created by the system contains addresses that aren't able to use a particular regulated currency. If you have access to the `DenyCap`, then you can use the `sui::coin` module to maintain the list of users. Use the functions `coin::deny_list_v2_add` and `coin::deny_list_v2_remove` functions to add and remove addresses.

### Global pause switch

Regulated currencies include an `allow_global_pause` Boolean field. When set to `true`, the bearer of the `DenyCapV2` object for the currency coin type can use the `coin::deny_list_v2_enable_global_pause` function to pause coin activity indefinitely. Immediately upon the bearer initiating the pause, the network disallows the coin type as input for any transactions. At the start of the next epoch (epochs last ~24 hours), the network additionally disallows all addresses from receiving the coin type.

When the bearer of the `DenyCapV2` object for the currency coin type removes the pause using `coin::deny_list_v2_disable_global_pause`, the coins are immediately available to use again as transaction inputs. Addresses cannot receive the coin type, however, until the following epoch.

The global pause functionality does not affect the deny list for the currency. After clearing the pause for the currency, any addresses included in the deny list are still unable to interact with the currency's coin.

## Currency metadata

Currency metadata is stored centrally within the `Currency<T>` object in the registry. Metadata updates are controlled by the `MetadataCap<T>` capability, which can be:

- **Unclaimed:** `MetadataCap` has not yet been claimed.
- **Claimed:** `MetadataCap` has been claimed and can be used for updates.
- **Deleted:** `MetadataCap` has been permanently deleted, preventing future updates.

### Metadata fields

The fields of the metadata objects include the following:

#### `CoinMetadata`

| Name          | Description                                |
| ------------- |--------------------------------------------|
| `registry`    | The `CoinRegistry` system object ID (`0x3`). |
| `decimals`    | The number of decimals the token uses. If you set this field to `3`, then a token of value `1000` would display as `1.000`. |
| `name`        | Name of the coin. |
| `symbol`      | Symbol for the coin. This might be the same value as `name`, but is typically fewer than five letters, all capitals. For example, `SUI` is the `symbol` for the native coin on Sui but its `name` is also `SUI`. **Only ASCII printable characters allowed**.|
| `description` | A short description to describe the token. |
| `icon_url`    | **Required field**. The URL for the token's icon, used for display in wallets, explorers, and other apps. |

## Minting and burning coins

The Coin Registry supports advanced supply management models:

- **Unknown supply:** Traditional minting/burning via `TreasuryCap`.
- **Fixed supply:** Total supply is permanently locked, no minting or burning allowed.
- **Burn-only supply:** No new minting allowed, but existing coins can be burned through registry functions.

### Mint

Use the `coin::mint` function to create new coins.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="mint" signatureOnly noComments />

The signature shows that a `Coin<T>` results from calling the function with a `TreasuryCap`, value for the coin created, and the transaction context. The function updates the total supply in `TreasuryCap` automatically. Upon display, the coin `value` respects the `decimals` value in the metadata. So, if you supply 1000000 as the coin `value` that has a `decimal` value of `6`, the coin's value displays as `1.000000`.

### Burn

For currencies with a burn-only supply status, coins can be burned directly through the registry using `coin_registry::burn` and `coin_registry::burn_balance` functions without requiring the `TreasuryCap`.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="burn,burn_balance" signatureOnly noComments />

For currencies with an unknown supply status, use the `coin::burn` function to destroy current coins.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="burn" signatureOnly noComments />

The signature shows that only the `TreasuryCap` and coin object you want to burn are necessary inputs, returning the amount by which the supply was decreased (value of the coin). The function does not allow you to burn more coins than are available in the supply.

## Adding and removing addresses to and from the deny list

The deny list is only applicable to regulated currencies. When you create a regulated currency, you receive a `DenyCapV2` that authorizes the bearer to add and remove addresses from the system-created `DenyList` object. Any address on the list for your currency is unable to use its coins as an input to transactions, starting immediately upon being added. At the epoch that follows address addition to the deny list, the addresses additionally cannot receive the coin type. In other words, an address that gets added to the deny list for a currency is immediately unable to send the coin. At the start of the following epoch, the address is still unable to send the coin but is also unable to receive it. From that point, the address cannot interact with the currency until expressly removed from the deny list by the `DenyCapV2` bearer.

## Update currency metadata

Metadata updates require the `MetadataCap<T>` object, which is only available to the bearer of the `TreasuryCap` for a currency. The bearer of the `TreasuryCap` can claim the `MetadataCap` using the `claim_metadata_cap` function only once. The `Currency` tracks the claimed status of the capability through its `metadata_cap_id` field.

The bearer of the `MetadataCap` can use the available getter functions to update values.

Manage the metadata capability using:

- `claim_metadata_cap<T>()`: Claim the metadata capability one time.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="claim_metadata_cap" noTitle noComments signatureOnly />

- `delete_metadata_cap<T>()`: Permanently delete the capability to prevent future updates.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="delete_metadata_cap" noTitle noComments signatureOnly />

    :::caution

    Deleting the `MetadataCap` using `delete_metadata_cap<T>()` is an irreversible action.

## Best practices

### For currency creators

- **Set supply model early:** Decide on supply model during initialization (fixed, burn-only, or flexible).
- **Consider regulation:** Evaluate whether deny list capabilities are needed.
- **Manage metadata cap:** Decide whether to keep, transfer, or delete the metadata capability.

### For dApp developers

- **Query registry first:** Check the registry for coin information before falling back to legacy methods.
- **Handle migration states:** Account for coins in various migration states.
- **Respect supply models:** Understand the implications of different supply states (fixed, burn-only, unknown).
- **Check regulatory status:** Be aware of regulated coins and their restrictions.

### For infrastructure providers

- **Monitor registry changes:** Track new coin registrations and updates.
- **Index supply changes:** Monitor burn events for burn-only coins.
- **Handle legacy coins:** Support both registry and legacy metadata systems.
- **Cache efficiently:** Registry data changes infrequently and can be cached.

### Security considerations

**Capability security:**
- **`MetadataCap`:** Protect metadata capabilities as they control coin branding.
- **`TreasuryCap`:** Treasury capabilities determine minting/burning permissions.
- **`DenyCapV2`:** Deny capabilities can restrict coin usage.

**Validation:**
The registry enforces several important validations:
- **Symbol validation:** Symbols must be ASCII printable characters.
- **Uniqueness:** Each coin type can only be registered once.
- **Supply consistency:** Supply states cannot be downgraded.
- **Permission checks:** Only appropriate capability holders can make changes.

**Migration safety:**
- **One-time migration:** Legacy metadata can only be migrated once.
- **Capability proof:** Metadata deletion requires capability ownership.
- **State consistency:** Regulatory state migration prevents double-setting.
