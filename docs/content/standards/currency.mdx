The Currency Standard is a technical standard used by Move smart contracts for creating currency on Sui. The `sui::coin_registry` module provides the logic that defines the standard, providing unified metadata, enhanced supply tracking, and improved regulatory features.

The standardization of currency creation on Sui means that wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts can manage currency created on Sui the same as they manage SUI, without any additional processing logic.

See [Sui Tokenomics](/concepts/tokenomics.mdx) to learn more about the SUI native currency and its use on the network.

Currency on Sui can offer specialized abilities while following the Currency Standard. For example, you can create regulated currency that allows its creator to add specific addresses to a deny list, so that the identified addresses cannot use the currency as inputs to transactions. Both legacy and registry systems support regulated currency with varying levels of sophistication.

## Fungible tokens

On Sui, the `Currency<T>` type represents open-loop fungible tokens (see `Token<T>` for closed-loop tokens). Currencies are denominated by their type parameter, `T`, which is also associated with metadata (like name, symbol, decimal precision, and so on) that applies to all instances of `Currency<T>`. The `sui::coin_registry` module exposes an interface over `Currency<T>` that treats it as fungible, meaning that a unit of `T` held in one instance of `Currency<T>` is interchangeable with any other unit of `T`, much like how traditional fiat currencies operate.

## Currency creation 

The Coin Registry is a centralized system that provides unified currency management through the `sui::coin_registry` module. 

:::info

The registry is a system-level shared object located at address `0xc`.

</details>

#### Core components

**`CoinRegistry`:** The main system object that coordinates all currency-related operations. This shared object serves as the entry point for all registry operations and is created once during network initialization. It's address is `0xc`.

**`Currency<T>`:** The core of the registry system, storing comprehensive information about each coin type including:
- **Metadata management:** Basic currency information like name, symbol, decimals, description, and icon URL.
- **Supply tracking:** Maintains supply state information (fixed, burn-only, or unknown).
- **Regulatory status:** Tracks whether the coin is regulated with deny list capabilities.
- **Capability references:** Links to `TreasuryCap`s and `MetadataCap`s for the coin type.
- **Extensibility:** Includes extra fields for future enhancements.

#### Supply states

The registry supports three different supply management models:

- **Fixed supply:** The total supply is permanently locked and cannot be changed.
- **Burn-only supply:** New coins cannot be minted, but existing coins can be burned.
- **Uncontrolled supply:** `TreasuryCap` holder controls minting and burning.

#### Regulatory states

Currencies can have different regulatory states:

- **Regulated:** The currency has an associated `DenyCapV2` that can restrict addresses from using it.
- **Unregulated:** The currency was created without any deny list capabilities.
- **Unknown:** Regulatory status is undetermined, typically from legacy migrations.

#### Creation options

The registry supports two different currency creation flows:

- **Standard creation (recommended):**

    Use the `new_currency` function at any time after the currency type is published. The function immediately creates a shared `Currency<T>` object. The type `T` must be a key-only type, as in `public struct MyCoin has key { id: UID }`.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="new_currency" signatureOnly noComments />

- **One-Time Witness (OTW) creation:**

    :::caution 

    OTW creation of a new currency is a two-step process. The initialization process begins with package publication. Then, a call to `finalize_registration` is needed to place the currency into the registry.

    :::

    The `new_currency_with_otw` function uses an OTW for uniqueness proof. See [One-Time Witness](https://move-book.com/programmability/one-time-witness) in The Move Book for more information.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="new_currency_with_otw" signatureOnly noComments />

#### Currency initialization

Both creation methods return a `CurrencyInitializer<T>` that allows for additional configuration:

- **Make regulated:** Add deny list capabilities.
- **Set supply model:** Choose between fixed, burn-only, or flexible supply.
- **Add extensions:** Include additional fields for custom functionality.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" struct="CurrencyInitializer" />

#### Currency finalization

A currency is not complete until after you call the `finalize` function. The function returns the `MetadataCap<T>` for metadata management. If you used an OTW to create the currency, the function sends the currency to the coin registry; otherwise, it creates the final shared `Currency<T>` object.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="finalize" signatureOnly />

If you publish a package that uses an OTW to create a currency in the package `init` function, then a call must be made to `finalize_registration` after initialization. The function transforms the currency into a shared object. 

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="finalize_registration" signatureOnly />

## Regulated currency

The Currency Standard supports creating regulated coins. Use the `make_regulated` function during the initialization phase before calling `finalize`. The function adds deny list capabilities to the `Currency<T>` and tracks the regulatory status within the Coin Registry. The function returns a `DenyCap` that allows the bearer to maintain the list of addresses on the deny list.

</details>

### `DenyList` object

A `DenyList` shared object created by the system contains addresses that aren't able to use a particular regulated currency. If you have access to the `DenyCap`, then you can use the `sui::coin` module to maintain the list of users. Use the functions `coin::deny_list_v2_add` and `coin::deny_list_v2_remove` functions to add and remove addresses.

### Global pause switch

Regulated currencies include an `allow_global_pause` Boolean field. When set to `true`, the bearer of the `DenyCapV2` object for the currency coin type can use the `coin::deny_list_v2_enable_global_pause` function to pause coin activity indefinitely. Immediately upon the bearer initiating the pause, the network disallows the coin type as input for any transactions. At the start of the next epoch (epochs last ~24 hours), the network additionally disallows all addresses from receiving the coin type.

When the bearer of the `DenyCapV2` object for the currency coin type removes the pause using `coin::deny_list_v2_disable_global_pause`, the coins are immediately available to use again as transaction inputs. Addresses cannot receive the coin type, however, until the following epoch.

The global pause functionality does not affect the deny list for the currency. After clearing the pause for the currency, any addresses included in the deny list are still unable to interact with the currency's coin.

## `TreasuryCap`

When you create a currency using the `coin_registry::new_currency` or `coin_registry::new_currency_with_otw` functions, the publisher of the smart contract that creates the coin receives a `TreasuryCap` object upon finalization of the currency. The `TreasuryCap` object is required to mint new currency coins or to burn current ones (depending on currency supply state). Consequently, only addresses that have access to this object are able to maintain the currency supply on the Sui network.

The `TreasuryCap` object is transferable, so a third party can take over the management of a currency that you create if you transfer the `TreasuryCap` to them. After transferring the object, you are no longer able to mint and burn coins yourself.

## Currency metadata

Currency metadata is stored centrally within the `Currency<T>` object in the registry. Metadata updates are controlled by the `MetadataCap<T>` capability, which can be:

- **Unclaimed:** `MetadataCap` has not yet been claimed.
- **Claimed:** `MetadataCap` has been claimed and can be used for updates. 
- **Deleted:** `MetadataCap` has been permanently deleted, preventing future updates.

### Metadata fields

The fields of the metadata objects include the following:

#### `CoinMetadata`

| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registry`          | The `CoinRegistry` system object ID (`0x3`).                                                                                                                                                             |
| `decimals`    | The number of decimals the token uses. If you set this field to `3`, then a token of value `1000` would display as `1.000`.                                                                              |
| `name`        | Name of the coin.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `symbol`      | Symbol for the coin. This might be the same value as `name`, but is typically fewer than five letters, all capitals. For example, `SUI` is the `symbol` for the native coin on Sui but its `name` is also `SUI`. **Only ASCII printable characters allowed**.|
| `description` | A short description to describe the token.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `icon_url`    | **Required field**. The URL for the token's icon, used for display in wallets, explorers, and other apps.                                                                                                                    |

## Minting and burning coins

The Coin Registry supports advanced supply management models:

- **Unknown supply:** Traditional minting/burning via `TreasuryCap`.
- **Fixed supply:** Total supply is permanently locked, no minting or burning allowed.
- **Burn-only supply:** No new minting allowed, but existing coins can be burned through registry functions.

### Mint

Use the `coin::mint` function to create new coins.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="mint" signatureOnly noComments />

The signature shows that a `Coin<T>` results from calling the function with a `TreasuryCap`, value for the coin created, and the transaction context. The function updates the total supply in `TreasuryCap` automatically. Upon display, the coin `value` respects the `decimals` value in the metadata. So, if you supply 1000000 as the coin `value` that has a `decimal` value of `6`, the coin's value displays as `1.000000`.

### Burn

For currencies with a burn-only supply status, coins can be burned directly through the registry using `coin_registry::burn` and `coin_registry::burn_balance` functions without requiring the `TreasuryCap`.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="burn,burn_balance" signatureOnly noComments />

For currencies with an unknown supply status, use the `coin::burn` function to destroy current coins.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="burn" signatureOnly noComments />

The signature shows that only the `TreasuryCap` and coin object you want to burn are necessary inputs, returning the amount by which the supply was decreased (value of the coin). The function does not allow you to burn more coins than are available in the supply.

## Adding and removing addresses to and from the deny list

The deny list is only applicable to regulated currencies. When you create a regulated currency, you receive a `DenyCapV2` that authorizes the bearer to add and remove addresses from the system-created `DenyList` object. Any address on the list for your currency is unable to use its coins as an input to transactions, starting immediately upon being added. At the epoch that follows address addition to the deny list, the addresses additionally cannot receive the coin type. In other words, an address that gets added to the deny list for a currency is immediately unable to send the coin. At the start of the following epoch, the address is still unable to send the coin but is also unable to receive it. From that point, the address cannot interact with the currency until expressly removed from the deny list by the `DenyCapV2` bearer.

### Add address to deny list

Use the `coin::deny_list_v2_add` function to add the provided address to the deny list for your coin. The signature for the function is:

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="deny_list_v2_add" noComments />

When using this function, you provide the `DenyList` object (`0x403`), the `DenyCap` you receive on coin creation, the address to add to the list, and the transaction context. After using this function, the address you provide is unable to use your coin by the next epoch.

### Remove address from deny list

Use the `coin::deny_list_v2_remove` function to remove addresses from the deny list for your coin.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="deny_list_v2_remove" noComments />

When using this function, you provide the `DenyList` object (`0x403`), the `DenyCapV2` you receive on coin creation, the address to remove from the list, and the transaction context. If you try to remove an address that isn't on the list, you receive an `ENotFrozen` error and the function aborts. After calling this function, the address you provide is able to use your coin by the next epoch.

### Using an SDK

You can use either the TypeScript or Rust SDK to manipulate the addresses held in the `DenyList` for your coin. The following examples are based on the [regulated coin sample](https://github.com/MystenLabs/regulated-coin-sample).

<Tabs groupId="sdk-language">

<TabItem label="TypeScript" value="typescript">

```ts
const tx = new Transaction();

tx.moveCall({
    target: `0x2::coin::deny_list_v2_add`,
    arguments: [
        tx.object(<SUI-DENY-LIST-OBJECT-ID>),
        tx.object(<DENY-CAP-ID>),
        tx.pure.address(options.address),
    ],
    typeArguments: [<COIN-TYPE>],
});
```

- `<SUI-DENY-LIST-OBJECT-ID>` is `"0x403"`.
- `<DENY-CAP-ID>` is the object of type `DenyCapV2<REGULATED_COIN>` you receive from publishing the contract.
- `options.address` is the address to ban.
- `<COIN-TYPE>` is `${PACKAGE-ID}::${MODULE-NAME}::${COIN-NAME}`, which is `${PACKAGE-ID}::regulated_coin::REGULATED_COIN` based on the example.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Rust" value="rust">

```rust
let mut ptb = ProgrammableTransactionBuilder::new();

let deny_list = ptb.obj(ObjectArg::SharedObject {
    id: deny_list.0,
    initial_shared_version: deny_list.1,
    mutable: true,
})?;
let deny_cap = ptb.obj(ObjectArg::ImmOrOwnedObject(deny_cap))?;
let address = ptb.pure(cmd.address())?;
ptb.command(Command::move_call(
    SUI_FRAMEWORK_PACKAGE_ID,
    Identifier::from(COIN_MODULE_NAME),
    Identifier::from_str("deny_list_v2_add".to_string())?,
    vec![<otw-type>],
    vec![deny_list, deny_cap, address],
));

let builder = ptb.finish();
```

- `deny_list` is of type `(ObjectID, SequenceNumber)`.
  - `ObjectID` is `0x403`.
  - `SequenceNumber` is the `initial_shared_version` of the `DenyList` singleton.
- `deny_cap` is the `ObjectRef` (`(ObjectID, SequenceNumber, ObjectDigest)`) of the `DenyCapV2<REGULATED_COIN>` the publisher has received.
- `otw_type` is the `TypeTag` created from `<PACKAGE_ID>::regulated_coin::REGULATED_COIN` type.
- `cmd.address()` returns the address to ban as a `SuiAddress`.

</TabItem>

## Globally pausing and unpausing regulated coin activity

Globally pausing coin activity is only applicable to regulated coin types.

### Pause coin activity

To pause activity across the network for a regulated coin type with the `allow_global_pause` field set to `true`, use `coin::deny_list_v2_enable_global_pause`. You must provide the `DenyCapV2` object for the coin type to initiate the pause. Transaction activity is paused immediately, and no addresses can receive the coin in the epoch that follows the call to pause.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="deny_list_v2_enable_global_pause" noComments signatureOnly />

### Unpause coin activity

To restart network activity for a paused regulated coin, use the `coin::deny_list_v2_disable_global_pause` function. As with pausing, you must provide the `DenyCapV2` object for the coin type. Transaction activity resumes immediately, and addresses can begin receiving the coin in the epoch that follows the call to remove the pause.

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/coin.move" mode="code" fun="deny_list_v2_disable_global_pause" noComments signatureOnly />

Metadata updates require the `MetadataCap<T>` object, which is only available to the bearer of the `TreasuryCap` for a currency. The bearer of the `TreasuryCap` can claim the `MetadataCap` using the `claim_metadata_cap` function only once. The `Currency` tracks the claimed status of the capability through its `metadata_cap_id` field.

The bearer of the `MetadataCap` can use the available getter functions to update values.

    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="delete_metadata_cap" noTitle noComments signatureOnly />

    :::caution

    Deleting the `MetadataCap` using `delete_metadata_cap<T>()` is an irreversible action.

    :::

## Migration from Coin to Currency Standard

The Currency Standard replaces the legacy Coin Standard. Sui provides a migration path from the `CoinMetadata<T>` system while maintaining backward compatibility.

The migration system is designed with specific constraints to maintain data integrity and preserve existing functionality. Migration can only occur permissionlessly when done by reference, meaning the original `CoinMetadata` object remains intact while its data is copied to create a new `Currency` entry in the registry. This approach allows for safe registration of new currency data and updates to existing currency data, but only as long as the `MetadataCap` has not yet been claimed.

The system cannot allow permissionless migration by value, however, where the original `CoinMetadata` object would be consumed or destroyed during migration. This restriction exists because some coins have governance mechanisms that control `CoinMetadata` updates. Allowing value-based migration would irreversibly break those existing governance workflows by destroying the metadata objects that governance systems expect to manage.

The destruction of legacy `CoinMetadata` objects is only permitted after the corresponding `MetadataCap` has been claimed, serving as proof that the currency's owner has taken control through the new registry system. This ensures that legacy metadata cannot be accidentally destroyed while governance systems still depend on it, and provides a clear transition path where owners must explicitly claim control before legacy objects can be cleaned up.

This design preserves backward compatibility while enabling a smooth transition to the centralized registry system, protecting existing governance mechanisms until owners are ready to migrate fully to the new system.

Some of the benefits to migrate to the Coin Registry include:

- **Centralized management:** Single source of truth for all coin information.
- **Enhanced features:** Access to advanced supply models and regulatory tracking.
- **Ecosystem integration:** Better support for wallets, exchanges, and dApps.
- **Future-proofing:** Access to ongoing registry enhancements.

### Migration process

1. **Metadata migration:** Use `migrate_legacy_metadata<T>()` to create a new `Currency<T>` entry based on existing `CoinMetadata<T>` information.
    <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="migrate_legacy_metadata" noTitle signatureOnly noComments />

1. **Regulatory migration:** For coins with deny list capabilities, use:
   - `migrate_regulated_state_by_metadata<T>()`: Migrate based on existing metadata.

        <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="migrate_regulated_state_by_metadata" noTitle signatureOnly noComments />
   
   - `migrate_regulated_state_by_cap<T>()`: Migrate based on deny capability.
    
        <ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="migrate_regulated_state_by_cap" noTitle signatureOnly noComments />

### Migration function mappings

Smart contracts should update logic that relies on the `coin` module to use the `coin_registry` module instead:  

- `coin::create_currency` -> `coin_registry::new_currency_with_otw`
- `coin::create_regulated_currency_v2` -> `coin_registry::new_currency_with_otw`

<ImportContent source="crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources/registries/coin_registry.move" mode="code" fun="new_currency_with_otw" signatureOnly noComments />

## Best practices

### For currency creators

- **Use OTW creation:** Prefer the OTW-based creation for better uniqueness guarantees.
- **Set supply model early:** Decide on supply model during initialization (fixed, burn-only, or flexible).
- **Consider regulation:** Evaluate whether deny list capabilities are needed.
- **Manage metadata cap:** Decide whether to keep, transfer, or delete the metadata capability.

### For dApp developers

- **Query registry first:** Check the registry for coin information before falling back to legacy methods.
- **Handle migration states:** Account for coins in various migration states.
- **Respect supply models:** Understand the implications of different supply states (fixed, burn-only, unknown).
- **Check regulatory status:** Be aware of regulated coins and their restrictions.

### For infrastructure providers

- **Monitor registry changes:** Track new coin registrations and updates.
- **Index supply changes:** Monitor burn events for burn-only coins.
- **Handle legacy coins:** Support both registry and legacy metadata systems.
- **Cache efficiently:** Registry data changes infrequently and can be cached.

### Security considerations

**Capability security:**
- **`MetadataCap`:** Protect metadata capabilities as they control coin branding.
- **`TreasuryCap`:** Treasury capabilities determine minting/burning permissions.
- **`DenyCapV2`:** Deny capabilities can restrict coin usage.

**Validation:**
The registry enforces several important validations:
- **Symbol validation:** Symbols must be ASCII printable characters.
- **Uniqueness:** Each coin type can only be registered once.
- **Supply consistency:** Supply states cannot be downgraded.
- **Permission checks:** Only appropriate capability holders can make changes.

**Migration safety:**
- **One-time migration:** Legacy metadata can only be migrated once.
- **Capability proof:** Metadata deletion requires capability ownership.
- **State consistency:** Regulatory state migration prevents double-setting.
