The Take Profit Stop Loss (TPSL) module enables conditional orders that automatically execute when certain price conditions are met. This allows traders to set up automated trading strategies that protect against losses (stop loss) or lock in profits (take profit) without requiring constant monitoring.

## How TPSL works

1. **Create a condition:** Define whether the order should trigger when the price goes above or below a specified trigger price.
2. **Create a pending order:** Specify the order details (limit or market order) that will be placed when the condition is met.
3. **Add conditional order:** Combine the condition and pending order, and add them to your margin manager.
4. **Execution:** Anyone can call the permissionless `execute_conditional_orders` function to execute orders whose conditions are met. This is typically handled by keepers or bots monitoring the market.

Conditional orders are stored in sorted vectors for efficient execution:
- `trigger_below`: Orders that trigger when price falls below the trigger price (sorted high to low)
- `trigger_above`: Orders that trigger when price rises above the trigger price (sorted low to high)

## API

### Helper functions

Use these functions to create conditions and pending orders for conditional orders.

<details>
<summary>Create a condition</summary>

Create a new condition that specifies when the order should trigger.

/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a pending limit order</summary>

Create a pending limit order that will be placed when the condition is met. Order type must be `no_restriction` or `immediate_or_cancel`.

	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="add_conditional_order"
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cancel conditional order</summary>

Cancel a specific conditional order by ID.

	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="cancel_conditional_order"
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cancel all conditional orders</summary>
