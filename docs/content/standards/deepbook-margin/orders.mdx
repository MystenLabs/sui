The `pool_proxy` module provides wrapper functions for trading with margin managers. These functions enable placing orders, modifying and canceling them, and managing staking and governance participation through a margin manager. All trading operations require the margin manager to be associated with the correct DeepBook pool.

## API

Following are the different public functions for managing orders with margin managers.
