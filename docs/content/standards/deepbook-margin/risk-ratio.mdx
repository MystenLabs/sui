Risk ratios are the core mechanism that governs leverage limits and position safety in DeepBook Margin. Understanding these ratios is essential for managing margin positions effectively.

## What is a risk ratio?

The **risk ratio** is defined as:

```
risk_ratio = total_assets / total_debts
```

Where assets and debts are valued in a common denomination using oracle prices. A higher risk ratio indicates a safer position with more collateral relative to debt.

- **Risk ratio = 2.0**: You have $2 of assets for every $1 of debt (50% LTV)
- **Risk ratio = 1.25**: You have $1.25 of assets for every $1 of debt (80% LTV)
- **Risk ratio = 1.0**: Your assets exactly equal your debts (100% LTV, insolvent)

## Risk ratio thresholds

Each trading pair has four risk ratio thresholds that control different operations:

### Min Withdraw Risk Ratio

The minimum risk ratio required **after** withdrawing collateral.

- If a withdrawal would cause your position's risk ratio to fall below this threshold, the withdrawal is rejected
- This prevents users from extracting too much collateral and leaving an unsafe position
- Typically set to 2.0 (50% LTV), meaning you must maintain at least $2 of assets per $1 of debt to withdraw

### Min Borrow Risk Ratio

The minimum risk ratio required **after** borrowing additional funds.

- If a borrow would cause your position's risk ratio to fall below this threshold, the borrow is rejected
- This determines the maximum leverage available for the trading pair
- A min borrow ratio of 1.25 allows approximately 5x leverage
- A min borrow ratio of 1.5 allows approximately 3x leverage

### Liquidation Risk Ratio

The risk ratio threshold at which a position becomes **eligible for liquidation**.

- When a position's risk ratio falls to or below this value, anyone can liquidate the position
- This is the "danger zone" - if price moves against you and your ratio hits this level, you can be liquidated
- Typically set between 1.1 and 1.2 depending on asset volatility

### Target Liquidation Risk Ratio

The target risk ratio that liquidation aims to restore the position to.

- Liquidation repays enough debt to bring the position back to a healthy state at this ratio
- This ensures the position is safe after liquidation, not just barely above the liquidation threshold
- Typically equals the Min Borrow Risk Ratio

## How leverage is determined

The maximum leverage for a trading pair is determined by the Min Borrow Risk Ratio:

```
max_leverage ≈ 1 / (1 - 1/min_borrow_risk_ratio)
```

| Min Borrow Risk Ratio | Approximate Max Leverage |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1.25 | 5x |
| 1.5 | 3x |
| 2.0 | 2x |

## Example: SUI/USDC position lifecycle

Consider a SUI/USDC position with the following risk parameters:
- Min Withdraw Risk Ratio: 2.0
- Min Borrow Risk Ratio: 1.25
- Liquidation Risk Ratio: 1.1
- Target Liquidation Risk Ratio: 1.25

**Opening a position:**
1. You deposit 100 USDC as collateral
2. You borrow 80 USDC worth of SUI (risk ratio = 100/80 = 1.25, at the minimum)
3. You now have 5x leveraged exposure to SUI

**Price moves in your favor:**
1. SUI price increases 10%
2. Your assets are now worth 108 USDC, debt is still 80 USDC
3. Risk ratio = 108/80 = 1.35 (safer position)
4. You can withdraw some profit, as long as ratio stays above 2.0

**Price moves against you:**
1. SUI price drops, your assets fall to 88 USDC
2. Risk ratio = 88/80 = 1.1 (at liquidation threshold)
3. Your position can now be liquidated by anyone
4. Liquidator repays part of your debt and receives collateral plus a reward
5. After liquidation, your remaining position has a risk ratio of 1.25

## Liquidation rewards

When a position is liquidated:

- **User Liquidation Reward**: A percentage of the liquidated amount paid to the liquidator as incentive (typically 2%)
- **Pool Liquidation Reward**: A percentage paid to the margin pool to cover potential bad debt (typically 3%)

These rewards ensure liquidators are incentivized to maintain system health and the protocol has reserves against defaults.

## Risk management best practices

1. **Monitor your risk ratio**: Keep track of your position's health, especially during volatile markets
2. **Maintain a buffer**: Don't borrow up to the maximum - leave room for price fluctuations
3. **Set stop losses**: Use TPSL orders to automatically close positions before liquidation
4. **Understand the assets**: Higher volatility assets typically have stricter risk parameters (lower leverage)
