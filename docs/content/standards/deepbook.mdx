DeepBook is a next-generation decentralized central limit order book (CLOB) built on Sui. DeepBook leverages Sui's parallel execution and low transaction fees to bring a highly performant, low-latency exchange on chain. 

## Versioning

The latest development iteration of DeepBook is version 3 (DeepBookV3). [DeepBookV3](./deepbookv3.mdx) is currently available across all Sui networks. [DeepBookV2](./deepbookv2.mdx) is currently still available to provide time for legacy contracts to migrate to DeepBookV3.
