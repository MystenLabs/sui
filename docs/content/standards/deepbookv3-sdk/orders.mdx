Placing orders is a main function of any DeepBook integration. Before you can place orders, though, you must first set up a balance manager. See [DeepBookV3 SDK](../deepbookv3-sdk.mdx) for information on setting up a balance manager.

## Order functions

The DeepBookV3 SDK provides the following functions for leveraging orders against pools.

### placeLimitOrder

Use `placeLimitOrder` to place limit orders. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `params`: `SwapParams` object that represents the parameters for the swap.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="placeLimitOrder" signatureOnly/>

### placeMarketOrder

Use `placeMarketOrder` to place market orders. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `params`: `SwapParams` object that represents the parameters for the swap.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="placeMarketOrder" signatureOnly/>

### cancelOrder

Use `cancelOrder` to cancel an existing order that is identified by the `orderId` that you provide. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

:::warning
The `orderId` is the protocol `orderId` generated during order placement, which is different from the client `orderId`.
:::

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool from which to borrow.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the `BalanceManager`.
- `orderId`: String of the protocol order ID that identifies the order to cancel.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="cancelOrder" signatureOnly/>

### cancelAllOrders

Use `cancelAllOrders` to cancel every order for the balance manager whose key you provide. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool from which to borrow.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the `BalanceManager`.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="cancelAllOrders" signatureOnly/>

### `modifyOrder`

Use `modifyOrder` to modify an existing order by changing its quantity. The new quantity must be less than the original quantity and more than the filled quantity. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the `BalanceManager`.
- `orderId`: String of the protocol order ID to modify.
- `newQuantity`: Number representing the new quantity for the order.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="modifyOrder" signatureOnly/>

### `withdrawSettledAmounts`

Use `withdrawSettledAmounts` to withdraw all settled amounts for a balance manager in a specific pool. The call returns a function that takes a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the `BalanceManager`.

<ImportContent source="packages/deepbook-v3/src/transactions/deepbook.ts" mode="code" org="MystenLabs" repo="ts-sdks" fun="withdrawSettledAmounts" signatureOnly/>

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate some custom functions for DeepBookV3 orders.

### Limit orders

See the [Order API](../deepbookv3/orders) for the different order types and self matching options.

```tsx
// Params for limit order
interface PlaceLimitOrderParams {
	poolKey: string;
	balanceManagerKey: string;
	clientOrderId: string;
	price: number;
	quantity: number;
	isBid: boolean;
	expiration?: number | bigint; // Default no expiration
	orderType?: OrderType; // Default no restrictions
	selfMatchingOption?: SelfMatchingOptions; // Default self matching allowed
	payWithDeep?: boolean; // Default true
}

/**
 * @description Place a limit order
 * @param {PlaceLimitOrderParams} params Parameters for placing a limit order
 * @returns A function that takes a Transaction object
 */
placeLimitOrder = (params: PlaceLimitOrderParams) => (tx: Transaction) => {};

// Example usage in DeepBookMarketMaker class
// Place a bid of 10 DEEP at $0.1
customPlaceLimitOrder = (tx: Transaction) => {
	const poolKey = 'DEEP_DBUSDC'; // Pool key, check constants.ts for more
	const managerKey = 'MANAGER_1'; // Balance manager key, initialized during client creation by user
	tx.add(
		this.deepBook.placeLimitOrder({
			poolKey: poolKey,
			balanceManagerKey: managerKey,
			clientOrderId: '1',
			price: 0.1,
			quantity: 10,
			isBid: true,
			payWithDeep: true,
		}),
	);
};
```

### Place market order

Example of placing a market order.

```tsx
// Params for market order
interface PlaceMarketOrderParams {
	poolKey: string;
	balanceManagerKey: string;
	clientOrderId: string;
	quantity: number;
	isBid: boolean;
	selfMatchingOption?: SelfMatchingOptions;
	payWithDeep?: boolean;
}

// Example usage in DeepBookMarketMaker class
// Place a market sell of 10 SUI in the SUI_DBUSDC pool
customPlaceMarketOrder = (tx: Transaction) => {
	const poolKey = 'SUI_DBUSDC'; // Pool key, check constants.ts for more
	const managerKey = 'MANAGER_1'; // Balance manager key, initialized during client creation by user
	tx.add(
		this.deepBook.placeMarketOrder({
			poolKey: poolKey,
			balanceManagerKey: managerKey,
			clientOrderId: '2',
			quantity: 10,
			isBid: true,
			payWithDeep: true,
		}),
	);
};
```

### Cancel an order

Example of canceling a single order in a pool for a balance manager.

```tsx
/**
 * @description Cancel an existing order
 * @param {string} poolKey The key to identify the pool
 * @param {string} balanceManagerKey The key to identify the BalanceManager
 * @param {number} orderId Order ID to cancel
 * @returns A function that takes a Transaction object
 */
cancelOrder =
	(poolKey: string, balanceManagerKey: string, orderId: number) => (tx: Transaction) => {};

// Example usage in DeepBookMarketMaker class
// Cancel order 12345678 in SUI_DBUSDC pool
cancelOrder = (tx: Transaction) => {
	const poolKey = 'SUI_DBUSDC'; // Pool key, check constants.ts for more
	const managerKey = 'MANAGER_1'; // Balance manager key, initialized during client creation by user
	tx.add(this.deepBook.cancelOrder(poolKey, managerKey, 12345678));
};
```

### Cancel all orders

Example of canceling all orders in a pool for a balance manager.

```tsx
/**
 * @description Cancel all open orders for a balance manager
 * @param {string} poolKey The key to identify the pool
 * @param {string} balanceManagerKey The key to identify the BalanceManager
 * @returns A function that takes a Transaction object
 */
cancelAllOrders = (poolKey: string, balanceManagerKey: string) => (tx: Transaction) => {};

// Example usage in DeepBookMarketMaker class
// Cancel order 12345678 in SUI_DBUSDC pool
cancelOrder = (tx: Transaction) => {
	const poolKey = 'SUI_DBUSDC'; // Pool key, check constants.ts for more
	const managerKey = 'MANAGER_1'; // Balance manager key, initialized during client creation by user
	tx.add(this.deepBook.cancelAllOrders(poolKey, managerKey));
};
```
