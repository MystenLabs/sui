Examples of interacting with staking and governance. These functions typically require a `balanceManagerKey`, `poolKey`, or both. For details on these keys, see [DeepBookV3 SDK](../deepbookv3-sdk.mdx#keys). The SDK includes some default keys that you can view in the `constants.ts` file. 

See [Staking and Governance](../deepbookv3/staking-governance.mdx) for more information on the staking and governance API.

## Staking and governance functions

### stake

Use `stake` to stake an amount you specify into a specific pool. The call returns a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the balance manager.
- `stakeAmount`: Number representing the amount to stake.

```tsx
stake(poolKey: string, balanceManagerKey: string, stakeAmount: number);
```

### unstake

Use `unstake` to unstake from a particular pool. The call returns a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the balance manager.

```tsx
unstake(poolKey: string, balanceManagerKey: string);
```

### submitProposal

Use `submitProposal` to submit a governance proposal. The call returns a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `params`: A `ProposalParams` object that defines the proposal.

```tsx
submitProposal({ params: ProposalParams });
```

### vote

Use `vote` to vote on a proposal. The call returns a `Transaction` object.

**Parameters**

- `poolKey`: String that identifies the pool.
- `balanceManagerKey`: String that identifies the balance manager.
- `proposal_id`: String that identifies the proposal to vote on.

```tsx
vote(poolKey: string, balanceManagerKey: string, proposal_id: string)
```

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate custom staking and governance functions that you can place into the `DeepBookMarketMaker` class. 

### stake custom function

```tsx
stake = (
  poolKey: string, 
  balanceManagerKey: string, 
  stakeAmount: number
) => (tx: Transaction) => {}

// Custom function to stake 100 DEEP in DeepBookMarketMaker class
stake = (tx: Transaction) => {
  const poolKey = 'DBUSDT_DBUSDC';
  const balanceManagerKey = 'MANAGER_1';
  tx.add(this.governance.stake(poolKey, balanceManagerKey, 100));
};
```

### unstake custom function

```tsx
unstake = (
  poolKey: string, 
  balanceManagerKey: string
) => (tx: Transaction) => {}

// Custom function to unstake in DeepBookMarketMaker class
unstake = (tx: Transaction) => {
  const poolKey = 'DBUSDT_DBUSDC';
  const balanceManagerKey = 'MANAGER_1';
  tx.add(this.governance.unstake(poolKey, balanceManagerKey));
};
```

### submitProposal custom function

```tsx
// Proposal params
export interface ProposalParams {
  poolKey: string;
  balanceManagerKey: string;
  takerFee: number;
  makerFee: number;
  stakeRequired: number;
}

submitProposal = (params: ProposalParams) => (tx: Transaction) => {}

// Custom function to submit proposal in DeepBookMarketMaker class
submitProposal = (tx: Transaction) => {
  const poolKey = 'DBUSDT_DBUSDC';
  const balanceManagerKey = 'MANAGER_1';
  tx.add(
    this.governance.submitProposal({
      poolKey,
      balanceManagerKey,
      takerFee: 0.002,
      makerFee: 0.001,
      stakeRequired: 100,
    }),
  );
};
```

### vote custom function

```tsx
vote = (
  poolKey: string, 
  balanceManagerKey: string, 
  proposal_id: string
) => (tx: Transaction) => {}

// Custom function to vote in DeepBookMarketMaker class
vote = (tx: Transaction) => {
  const poolKey = 'DBUSDT_DBUSDC';
  const balanceManagerKey = 'MANAGER_1';
  const proposalID = '0x123456789';
  tx.add(this.governance.vote(poolKey, balanceManagerKey, proposalID));
};
```
