{@include: ../../snippets/deepbook.mdx}

The `BalanceManager` shared object holds all balances for different assets. To perform trades, pass a combination of `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` into a [pool](./design.mdx#pool). `TradeProof`s are generated in one of two ways, either by the `BalanceManager` owner directly, or by any `TradeCap` owner. The owner can generate a `TradeProof` without the risk of equivocation. The `TradeCap` owner, because it's an owned object, risks equivocation when generating a `TradeProof`. Generally, a high frequency trading engine trades as the default owner.

With exception to swaps, all interactions with DeepBook require a `BalanceManager` as one of its inputs. When orders are matched, funds are transferred to or from the `BalanceManager`. You can use a single `BalanceManager` between all pools.

## API

Following are the different public functions that the `BalanceManager` exposes.

### Create a `BalanceManager`

The `new()` function creates a `BalanceManager` hot potato (a struct with no abilities). Combine it with `share`, or else the transaction fails. You can combine the transaction with deposit calls, allowing you to create, deposit, then share the balance manager in one transaction.

### Mint a `TradeCap`

The owner of a `BalanceManager` can mint a `TradeCap` and send it to another address. Upon receipt, that address will have the capability to place orders with this `BalanceManager`. The address owner cannot deposit or withdraw funds, however. The maximum number of `TradeCap` that can be assigned for a `BalanceManager` is `1000`. If this limit is reached, one or more existing `TradeCap` must be revoked before minting new ones.

### Generate a `TradeProof`

To call any function that requires a balance check or transfer, the user must provide their `BalanceManager` as well as a `TradeProof`. There are two ways to generate a trade proof, one used by the owner and another used by a `TradeCap` owner.

### Deposit funds

Only the owner can deposit funds into the `BalanceManager`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=deposit}

### Withdraw funds

Only the owner can withdraw funds from the `BalanceManager`.
