The `BalanceManager` shared object holds all balances for different assets. To perform trades, pass a combination of `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` into a [pool](./design.mdx#pool). `TradeProof`s are generated in one of two ways, either by the `BalanceManager` owner directly, or by any `TradeCap` owner. The owner can generate a `TradeProof` without the risk of equivocation. The `TradeCap` owner, because it's an owned object, risks equivocation when generating a `TradeProof`. Generally, a high frequency trading engine trades as the default owner.

With exception to swaps, all interactions with DeepBookV3 require a `BalanceManager` as one of its inputs. When orders are matched, funds are transferred to or from the `BalanceManager`. You can use a single `BalanceManager` between all pools.

## API

Following are the different public functions that the `BalanceManager` exposes.

<details>
<summary>Create a `BalanceManager`</summary>

The `new()` function creates a `BalanceManager`. Combine it with `share`, or else the transaction fails. You can combine the transaction with deposit calls, allowing you to create, deposit, then share the balance manager in one transaction.

	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="new"

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a `BalanceManager` with custom owner</summary>

The `new_with_custom_owner()` function creates a `BalanceManager` with a custom owner. Combine it with `share`, or else the transaction fails. You can combine the transaction with deposit calls, allowing you to create, deposit, then share the balance manager in one transaction.

/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a `BalanceManager` with custom owner and capabilities</summary>

The `new_with_custom_owner_caps<App>()` function creates a `BalanceManager` with a custom owner and returns all three capabilities (`DepositCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `TradeCap`) in a single call. This function requires authorization through the DeepBook Registry with a specific `App` type. Combine the balance manager with `share`, or else the transaction fails. This is a convenient way to set up a complete balance manager with all necessary capabilities in one transaction.

:::caution
Move code using DeepBookV3 uses `DepositCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `TradeCap`, while the DeepBookV3 SDK uses `depositCap`, `withdrawCap`, and `tradeCap`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Mint a `TradeCap`</summary>

The owner of a `BalanceManager` can mint a `TradeCap` and send it to another address. Upon receipt, that address will have the capability to place orders with this `BalanceManager`. The address owner cannot deposit or withdraw funds, however. The maximum total number of `TradeCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `DepositCap` that can be assigned for a `BalanceManager` is `1000`. If this limit is reached, one or more existing caps must be revoked before minting new ones. You can also use `revoke_trade_cap` to revoke `DepositCap` and `WithdrawCap`.

<details>
<summary>Mint a `DepositCap` or `WithdrawCap`</summary>

The owner of a `BalanceManager` can mint a `DepositCap` or `WithdrawCap` and send it to another address. Upon receipt, that address will have the capability to deposit in or withdraw from `BalanceManager`. The address owner cannot execute trades, however. The maximum total number of `TradeCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `DepositCap` that can be assigned for a `BalanceManager` is `1000`. If this limit is reached, one or more existing caps must be revoked before minting new ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Generate a `TradeProof`</summary>

To call any function that requires a balance check or transfer, the user must provide their `BalanceManager` as well as a `TradeProof`. There are two ways to generate a trade proof, one used by the owner and another used by a `TradeCap` owner.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deposit funds</summary>

Only the owner can call this function to deposit funds into the `BalanceManager`.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move"

</details>

<details>
<summary>Withdraw funds</summary>

Only the owner can call this function to withdraw funds from the `BalanceManager`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deposit funds using `DepositCap`</summary>

Only holders of a `DepositCap` for the `BalanceManager` can call this function to deposit funds into the `BalanceManager`.

<details>
<summary>Withdraw funds using WithdrawCap</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Set and unset referral</summary>

The owner of a `TradeCap` can set or unset a pool-specific referral for the balance manager. Setting a referral allows the balance manager to be associated with a `DeepBookPoolReferral` for that pool, which can track and earn referral fees. Each balance manager can have different referrals for different pools.
