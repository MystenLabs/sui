The `BalanceManager` shared object holds all balances for different assets. To perform trades, pass a combination of `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` into a [pool](./design.mdx#pool). `TradeProof`s are generated in one of two ways, either by the `BalanceManager` owner directly, or by any `TradeCap` owner. The owner can generate a `TradeProof` without the risk of equivocation. The `TradeCap` owner, because it's an owned object, risks equivocation when generating a `TradeProof`. Generally, a high frequency trading engine trades as the default owner.

With exception to swaps, all interactions with DeepBookV3 require a `BalanceManager` as one of its inputs. When orders are matched, funds are transferred to or from the `BalanceManager`. You can use a single `BalanceManager` between all pools.

## API

Following are the different public functions that the `BalanceManager` exposes.

### Create a BalanceManager

The `new()` function creates a `BalanceManager` hot potato (a struct with no abilities). Combine it with `share`, or else the transaction fails. You can combine the transaction with deposit calls, allowing you to create, deposit, then share the balance manager in one transaction.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=new noComments}

### Create a BalanceManager with custom owner

The `new_with_owner()` function creates a `BalanceManager` hot potato (a struct with no abilities) with a custom owner. Combine it with `share`, or else the transaction fails. You can combine the transaction with deposit calls, allowing you to create, deposit, then share the balance manager in one transaction.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=new_with_owner noComments}

### Mint a TradeCap

The owner of a `BalanceManager` can mint a `TradeCap` and send it to another address. Upon receipt, that address will have the capability to place orders with this `BalanceManager`. The address owner cannot deposit or withdraw funds, however. The maximum total number of `TradeCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `DepositCap` that can be assigned for a `BalanceManager` is `1000`. If this limit is reached, one or more existing caps must be revoked before minting new ones. You can also use `revoke_trade_cap` to revoke `DepositCap` and `WithdrawCap`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=mint_trade_cap,revoke_trade_cap}

### Mint a DepositCap or WithdrawCap

The owner of a `BalanceManager` can mint a `DepositCap` or `WithdrawCap` and send it to another address. Upon receipt, that address will have the capability to deposit in or withdraw from `BalanceManager`. The address owner cannot execute trades, however. The maximum total number of `TradeCap`, `WithdrawCap`, and `DepositCap` that can be assigned for a `BalanceManager` is `1000`. If this limit is reached, one or more existing caps must be revoked before minting new ones.

### Generate a TradeProof

To call any function that requires a balance check or transfer, the user must provide their `BalanceManager` as well as a `TradeProof`. There are two ways to generate a trade proof, one used by the owner and another used by a `TradeCap` owner.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=generate_proof_as_owner,generate_proof_as_trader}

### Deposit funds

Only the owner can call this function to deposit funds into the `BalanceManager`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=deposit}

### Withdraw funds

Only the owner can call this function to withdraw funds from the `BalanceManager`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=withdraw,withdraw_all}

### Deposit funds using DepositCap

Only holders of a `DepositCap` for the `BalanceManager` can call this function to deposit funds into the `BalanceManager`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=deposit_with_cap}

### Withdraw funds using WithdrawCap

Only holders of a `WithdrawCap` for the `BalanceManager` can call this function to withdraw funds from the `BalanceManager`.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/balance_manager.move#fun=withdraw_with_cap}
