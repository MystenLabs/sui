title: Flash Loans
description: Use DeepBook to perform flash loans, uncollaterized loans that are borrowed and repaid within the same programmable transaction block.

{@include: ../../snippets/deepbook.mdx}

Flash loans by definition are uncollaterized loans that are borrowed and repaid within the same programmable transaction block. Users can borrow flash loans in the base or quote asset from any DeepBook pool. Flash loans return a `FlashLoan` hot potato (struct with no abilities), which must be returned back to the pool by the end of the call. The transaction is atomic, so the entire transaction fails if the loan is not returned. 

The quantity borrowed can be the maximum amount that the pool owns. Borrowing from a pool and trading in the same pool can result in failures because trading requires the movement of funds. If the funds are borrowed, then there are no funds to move.

## API

Following are the endpoints that the `Pool` exposes for flash loans.

### Borrow flash loan base

Borrow base assets from the `Pool`. The function returns a hot potato, forcing the borrower to return the assets within the same transaction.

### Borrow flash loan quote

Borrow quote assets from the `Pool`. The function returns a hot potato, forcing the borrower to return the assets within the same transaction.

### Retrieve flash loan base

Return the flash loaned base assets to the `Pool`. `FlashLoan` object is unwrapped only if the assets are returned, otherwise the transaction fails.

### Retrieve flash loan quote

Return the flash loaned quote assets to the `Pool`. `FlashLoan` object is unwrapped only if the assets are returned,
otherwise the transaction fails.
