title: Flash Loans
---

Users can borrow flash loans in the base or quote asset from any DeepBook pool. Flash loans return a FlashLoan hot potato, which must be returned back to the pool by the end of the call. Else, the transaction will fail. 
The quantity borrowed can be the maximum amount that the pool owns. Borrowing from a pool and trading in the same pool can result in failures because trading requires the movement of funds. If the funds are borrowed, then there are no funds to move.
