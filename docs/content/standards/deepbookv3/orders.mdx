Users can create limit or market orders, modify orders, and cancel orders. The `BalanceManager` must have the necessary funds to process orders. DeepBookV3 has four order options and three self matching options. If you set the `pay_with_deep` flag to `true`, trading fees are paid with the DEEP token. If you set the `pay_with_deep` flag to `false`, trading fees are paid with the input token.

Users can modify their existing order, reducing the size, lowering the expiration time, or both. Users cannot modify their order to increase their size or increase their expiration time. To do that, they must cancel the original order and place a new order.

Users can cancel a single order or cancel all of their orders.

## API

Following are the order related endpoints that `Pool` exposes.

### Order options

The following constants define the options available for orders.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/helper/constants.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	variable="NO_RESTRICTION,IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL,FILL_OR_KILL,POST_ONLY"
/>

### Self-matching options

The following constants define the options available for self-matching orders.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/helper/constants.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	variable="SELF_MATCHING_ALLOWED,CANCEL_TAKER,CANCEL_MAKER"
/>

### OrderInfo struct

Placing a limit order or a market order creates and returns an `OrderInfo` object. DeepBookV3 automatically drops this object after the order completes or is placed in the book. Use `OrderInfo` to inspect the execution details of the request as it represents all order information. DeepBookV3 does not catch any errors, so if there’s a failure of any kind, then the entire transaction fails.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/order_info.move"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	mode="code"
	struct="OrderInfo"
/>

### OrderDeepPrice struct

The `OrderDeepPrice` struct represents the conversion rate of DEEP at the time the order was placed.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/vault/deep_price.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="OrderDeepPrice"
/>

### Fill struct

The `Fill` struct represents the results of a match between two orders. Use this struct to update the state.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/fill.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="Fill"
/>

### Events

DeepBookV3 emits `OrderFilled` when a maker order is filled.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/order_info.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="OrderFilled"
/>

DeepBookV3 emits `OrderCanceled` when a maker order is canceled.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/order.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="OrderCanceled"
/>

DeepBookV3 emits `OrderModified` on modification of a maker order.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/order.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="OrderModified"
/>

DeepBookV3 emits `OrderPlaced` when it injects a maker order into the order book.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/book/order_info.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	struct="OrderPlaced"
/>

### Place limit order

Place a limit order. Quantity is in base asset terms. For current version `pay_with_deep` must be true, so the
fee is paid with DEEP tokens.

You must combine a `BalanceManager` call of generating a `TradeProof` before placing orders.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="place_limit_order"
	noComments
/>

### Place market order

Place a market order. Quantity is in base asset terms. Calls `place_limit_order` with a price of `MAX_PRICE` for bids and `MIN_PRICE` for asks. DeepBookV3 cancels the order for any quantity not filled.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="place_market_order"
	noComments
/>

### Modify order

Modifies an order given `order_id` and `new_quantity`. New quantity must be less than the original quantity and more than the filled quantity. Order must not have already expired.

The `modify_order` function does not return anything. If the transaction is successful, then assume the modification was successful.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="modify_order"
	noComments
/>

### Cancel order

Cancel an order. The order must be owned by the `balance_manager`. The order is removed from the book and the `balance_manager` open orders. The `balance_manager` balance is updated with the order's remaining quantity.

Similar to modify, `cancel_order` does not return anything. DeepBookV3 emits `OrderCanceled` event.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="cancel_order"
	noComments
/>

### Cancel multiple orders

Cancel multiple orders within a vector. The orders must be owned by the `balance_manager`. The orders are removed from the book and the `balance_manager` open orders. If any order fails to cancel, no orders will be cancelled (atomic operation).

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="cancel_orders"
	noComments
/>

### Cancel all orders

Cancel all open orders placed by the balance manager in the pool. This is a convenience function that cancels every order associated with the balance manager.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="cancel_all_orders"
	noComments
/>

### Withdraw settled amounts

Withdraw settled amounts to the `balance_manager`. All orders automatically withdraw settled amounts. This can be called explicitly to withdraw all settled funds from the pool.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="withdraw_settled_amounts"
	noComments
/>

### Withdraw settled amounts permissionless

Withdraw settled amounts to the `balance_manager` without requiring a `TradeProof`. This is a permissionless version that anyone can call to settle a balance manager's funds.

<ImportContent
	source="packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move"
	mode="code"
	org="MystenLabs"
	repo="deepbookv3"
	fun="withdraw_settled_amounts_permissionless"
	noComments
/>
