title: Query the Pool
---

{@include: ../../snippets/deepbook.mdx}

The `Pool` shared object represents a market, such as a SUI/USDC market. That `Pool` is the only one representing that unique pairing (SUI/USDC) and the pairing is the only member of that particular `Pool`. See [DeepBook Design](./design.mdx#pool) to learn more about the structure of pools.

To perform trades, you pass a `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` into the relvant `Pool`. Unlike `Pool`s, `BalanceManager` shared objects can contain any type of token, such that the same `BalanceManager` can access multiple `Pool`s to interact with many different trade pairings. See [BalanceManager](./balance-manager.mdx) to learn more.

## API 

DeepBook exposes a set of endpoints that can be used to query any pool.

### Check whitelist status

Accessor to check whether the pool is whitelisted.

```move
public fun whitelisted<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>): bool
```

### Check quote quantity against base

Dry run to determine the quote quantity out for a given base quantity.

```move
public fun get_quote_quantity_out<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    base_quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
): (u64, u64, u64)
```

### Check quote quantity against quote

Dry run to determine the base quantity out for a given quote quantity.

```move
public fun get_base_quantity_out<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    quote_quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
): (u64, u64, u64)
```

### Check quote quantity against quote or base

Dry run to determine the quantity out for a given base or quote quantity. Only one out of base or quote quantity should be non-zero. Returns the (`base_quantity_out`, `quote_quantity_out`, `deep_quantity_required`).

```move
public fun get_quantity_out<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    base_quantity: u64,
    quote_quantity: u64,
    clock: &Clock,
): (u64, u64, u64)
```

### Retrieve mid price for a pool 

Returns the mid price of the pool.

```move
public fun mid_price<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    clock: &Clock,
): u64
```

### Retrieve order IDs

Returns the `order_id` for all open orders for the `balance_manager` in the pool.

```move
public fun account_open_orders<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    balance_manager: ID,
): VecSet<u128>
```

### Retrieve prices and quantities for an order book

Returns vectors holding the prices (`price_vec`) and quantities (`quantity_vec`) for the level2 order book. The `price_low` and `price_high` are inclusive, all orders within the range are returned. `is_bid` is `true` for bids and `false` for asks.

```move
public fun get_level2_range<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    price_low: u64,
    price_high: u64,
    is_bid: bool,
): (vector<u64>, vector<u64>)
```

Returns vectors holding the prices (`price_vec`) and quantities (`quantity_vec`) for the level2 order book. `ticks` are the maximum number of ticks to return starting from best bid and best ask. (`bid_price`, `bid_quantity`, `ask_price`, `ask_quantity`) are returned as four vectors. The price vectors are sorted in descending order for bids and ascending order for asks.

```move
public fun get_level2_ticks_from_mid<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
    ticks: u64,
): (vector<u64>, vector<u64>, vector<u64>, vector<u64>)
```

### Retrieve balances

Get all balances held in this pool.

```move
public fun vault_balances<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
    self: &Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
): (u64, u64, u64)
```

### Retrieve Pool ID

Get the ID of the pool given the asset types.

```move
public fun get_pool_id_by_asset<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(registry: &Registry): ID
```
