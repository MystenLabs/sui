title: Query the Pool
---

{@include: ../../snippets/deepbook.mdx}

The `Pool` shared object represents a market, such as a SUI/USDC market. That `Pool` is the only one representing that unique pairing (SUI/USDC) and the pairing is the only member of that particular `Pool`. See [DeepBook Design](./design.mdx#pool) to learn more about the structure of pools.

To perform trades, you pass a `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` into the relevant `Pool`. Unlike `Pool`s, `BalanceManager` shared objects can contain any type of token, such that the same `BalanceManager` can access multiple `Pool`s to interact with many different trade pairings. See [BalanceManager](./balance-manager.mdx) to learn more.

## API 

DeepBook exposes a set of endpoints that can be used to query any pool.

### Check whitelist status

Accessor to check whether the pool is whitelisted.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=whitelisted noComments}

### Check quote quantity against base

Dry run to determine the quote quantity out for a given base quantity.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_quote_quantity_out noComments}

### Check base quantity against quote

Dry run to determine the base quantity out for a given quote quantity.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_base_quantity_out noComments}

### Check quote quantity against quote or base

Dry run to determine the quantity out for a given base or quote quantity. Only one out of base or quote quantity should be non-zero. Returns the (`base_quantity_out`, `quote_quantity_out`, `deep_quantity_required`).

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_quantity_out noComments}

### Check fee required

Returns the DEEP required for an order if it's a taker or maker given quantity and price (`deep_required_taker`, `deep_required_maker`).

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_order_deep_required noComments}

### Retrieve mid price for a pool 

Returns the mid price of the pool.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=mid_price noComments}

### Retrieve order IDs

Returns the `order_id` for all open orders for the `balance_manager` in the pool.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=account_open_orders noComments}

### Retrieve prices and quantities for an order book

Returns vectors holding the prices (`price_vec`) and quantities (`quantity_vec`) for the level2 order book. The `price_low` and `price_high` are inclusive, all orders within the range are returned. `is_bid` is `true` for bids and `false` for asks.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_level2_range noComments}

Returns vectors holding the prices (`price_vec`) and quantities (`quantity_vec`) for the level2 order book. `ticks` are the maximum number of ticks to return starting from best bid and best ask. (`bid_price`, `bid_quantity`, `ask_price`, `ask_quantity`) are returned as four vectors. The price vectors are sorted in descending order for bids and ascending order for asks.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_level2_ticks_from_mid noComments}

### Retrieve balances

Get all balances held in this pool.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=vault_balances noComments}

### Retrieve pool ID

Get the ID of the pool given the asset types.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_pool_id_by_asset noComments}

### Retrieve order information

Returns the `Order` struct using the order ID.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_order noComments}

Returns a vector of `Order` structs using a vector of order IDs.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_orders noComments}

Returns a vector of `Order` structs for all orders that belong to a `BalanceManager` in the pool.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_account_order_details noComments}

### Retrieve locked balance

Returns the locked balance for a `BalanceManager` in the pool (`base_quantity`, `quote_quantity`, `deep_quantity`).

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=locked_balance noComments}

### Retrieve pool parameters

Returns the trade parameters for the pool (`taker_fee`, `maker_fee`, `stake_required`).

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=pool_trade_params noComments}

Returns the book parameters for the pool (`tick_size`, `lot_size`, `min_size`).

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=pool_book_params noComments}

Returns the `OrderDeepPrice` struct for the pool, which determines the conversion for DEEP fees.

{@inject: github:MystenLabs/deepbookv3/packages/deepbook/sources/pool.move#fun=get_order_deep_price noComments}
