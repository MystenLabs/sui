title: Swaps
---

{@include: ../../snippets/deepbook.mdx}

DeepBook provides a swap-like interface commonly seen in automatic market makers (AMMs). Unlike the order functions, you can call `swap_exact_amount` without a `BalanceManager`. You call it directly with `Coin` objects instead. When swapping from base to quote, `base_in` must have a positive value while `quote_in` must be zero. When swapping from quote to base, `quote_in` must be positive and `base_in` zero. Some `deep_in` amount is required to pay for trading fees. You can overestimate this amount, as the unused DEEP tokens are returned at the end of the call.

You can use the `get_amount_out` endpoint to simulate a swap. The function returns the exact amount of DEEP tokens that the swap requires.

## API

Following are the endpoints that the `Pool` exposes for swaps.

### Swap exact base for quote

Swap exact base quantity without needing a `balance_manager`. DEEP quantity can be overestimated. Returns three `Coin` objects:     
    - `BaseAsset`
    - `QuoteAsset`
    - `DEEP` 

Some base quantity may be left over, if the input quantity is not divisible by lot size.

You can overestimate the amount of DEEP required. The remaining balance is returned.

### Swap exact quote for base

Swap exact quote quantity without needing a `balance_manager`. You can overestimate DEEP quantity. Returns three `Coin` objects:
    - `BaseAsset`
    - `QuoteAsset`
    - `DEEP`

Some quote quantity might be left over if the input quantity is not divisible by lot size.

### Swap exact quantity

This function is what the previous two functions call with `coin::zero()` set for the third coin. Users can call this directly for base → quote or quote → base as long as base or quote have a zero value.
