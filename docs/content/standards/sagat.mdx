## Using the Sagat SDK 

### Register public keys

Register Addresses: User  with the system (required before creating multisigs)

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L214-L222

### Creating and managing multisig 

Create Multisig: User creates a new multisig wallet with specified members, weights, and threshold

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L72-L94

View Multisig: User retrieves details about a specific multisig wallet

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L96-L100

Manage Proposers: Add or remove addresses that can create proposals for the multisig

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L297-L346

Get Multisig Connections: User retrieves all multisigs they're connected to across different public keys

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L283-L294

Get Address Info: User looks up public key information for a registered address

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L279-L281

### Multisig invitations 

View Invitations: User checks pending multisig invitations for their public key

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L234-L251

Accept Invitation: User accepts an invitation to join a multisig by signing a message

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L102-L113

Reject Invitation: User declines a multisig invitation

### Proposal creation and voting 

Create Proposal: User proposes a transaction for the multisig to execute

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L128-L134


View Proposals: User browses proposals for a multisig (with filtering by status, pagination)

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L136-L171


View Proposal by Digest: User looks up a specific proposal using its transaction digest

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L173-L177


Vote on Proposal: User approves or rejects a proposal by signing

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L179-L190

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L197-L208

### Proposal execution 

Verify Proposal: After executing a proposal on-chain, user marks it as completed or failed in the system to unblock the pending queue

https://github.com/MystenLabs/sagat/blob/313624a9d3b4b971b81b80be851b49e055067250/sdk/src/client.ts#L258-L265

Verify by Digest: Alternative verification method using the transaction digest
