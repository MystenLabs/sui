title: Wallet Standard
description: The Wallet Standard defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.
---

Browser extension wallets built for Sui are defined using the
[Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This is a cross-chain
standard that defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.

If you are building a wallet, we publish a helper library `@mysten/wallet-standard` which provides
types and utilities that make it simple to get started.

### Creating a wallet interface

You need to create a class that represents your wallet. You can use the `Wallet` interface from
`@mysten/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```tsx
import { SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN, Wallet } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	get version() {
		// Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).
		return '1.0.0';
	}
	get name() {
		return 'Wallet Name';
	}
	get icon() {
		return 'some-icon-data-url';
	}
	// Return the Sui chains that your wallet supports.
	get chains() {
		return [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN];
	}
}
```

### Implementing features

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the Sui
wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

- `standard:connect` - Used to initiate a connection to the wallet.
- `standard:events` - Used to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts
  being added or removed.
- `sui:signPersonalMessage` - Used to prompt the user to sign a personal message, and return the
  message signature back to the dApp. This can be used to verify the user’s public key.
- `sui:signTransaction` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction, and return the serialized
  transaction and signature back to the dApp. This method does not submit the transaction for
  execution.
- `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction, then submit it
  for execution to the blockchain.
- `sui:reportTransactionEffects` - Used to report the effects of a transaction executed in the dApp
  to the wallet. this allows the wallet to update it's internal state to reflect the changes made by
  the transaction.
- `sui:signTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `sui:signTransaction`. It should still be
  implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.
- `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - The previous version of `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction`. It
  should still be implemented for compatibility with dApps that have not updated to the new feature.

You can implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```tsx
import {
  ConnectFeature,
  ConnectMethod,
  EventsFeature,
  EventsOnMethod,
  SuiFeatures,
  SuiSignPersonalMessageMethod,
  SuiSignTransactionMethod,
  SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionMethod,
  SuiReportTransactionEffectsMethod
} from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	/* ... existing code from above ... */

  get features(): ConnectFeature & EventsFeature & SuiFeatures {
    return {
      "standard:connect": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        connect: this.#connect,
      },
      "standard:events": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        on: this.#on,
      },
			"sui:signPersonalMessage": {
        version: "1.0.0",
				signPersonalMessage: this.#signPersonalMessage,
			},
      "sui:signTransaction": {
        version: "2.0.0",
        signTransaction: this.#signTransaction,
      },
      "sui:signAndExecuteTransaction": {
        version: "2.0.0",
        signAndExecuteTransaction: this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,
      },
      "sui:reportTransactionEffects": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        reportTransactionEffects: this.#reportTransactionEffects,
    };
  },

  #on: EventsOnMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's events on implementation.
  };

  #connect: ConnectMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's connect implementation
  };

	#signPersonalMessage: SuiSignPersonalMessageMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signTransaction: SuiSignTransactionMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signAndExecuteTransaction: SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signAndExecuteTransaction implementation
  };

  #reportTransactionEffects: SuiReportTransactionEffectsMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's reportTransactionEffects implementation
  };
}
```

### Exposing accounts

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `accounts` interface. This should
expose all of the accounts that a connected dApp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating
a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts can use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to easily construct an account matching the
required interface.

```tsx
import { ReadonlyWalletAccount } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	get accounts() {
		// Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:
		return someWalletAccounts.map(
			(walletAccount) =>
				// Return
				new ReadonlyWalletAccount({
					address: walletAccount.suiAddress,
					publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,
					// The Sui chains that your wallet supports.
					chains: [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN],
					// The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.
					// These features must exist on the wallet as well.
					features: [
						'sui:signPersonalMessage',
						'sui:signTransactionBlock',
						'sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock',
					],
				}),
		);
	}
}
```

### Registering in the window

Once you have a compatible interface for your wallet, you register it using the `registerWallet`
function.

```tsx
import { registerWallet } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

registerWallet(new YourWallet());
```

### Best practices for efficient Transaction Execution

The wallet standard has recently been updated to reflect changes being implemented across the Sui
ecosystem. With the migration the new GraphQL API the previous `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock`
feature will become harder to maintain, and has been closely tied to the JSON RPC options and data
structures.

The new `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` feature will be easier to implement for wallet builders
regardless of which API they are using to execute transactions. This simplicity comes at the expense
of flexibility in what is returned from the `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction` feature.

The solution to this problem is to use the `sui:signTransaction` feature to sign transactions, and
leave transaction execution up to the dApp, allowing it to query for additional data during
execution, using whichever API the dapp is using. This is consistent with the default we have used
in `@mysten/dapp-kit` for the `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` hook, and enables dApps to take
advantage of read-after-write consistency when interacting with the full-node based JSON RPC API.

The downside of this strategy has been that wallets end up using different RPC nodes than the dApp,
and may not have indexed the previous transaction when executing multiple transactions in rapid
succession. This leads to building transactions using stale data, that will fail when executed.

To mitigate this, wallets can use the `sui:reportTransactionEffects` feature so that apps can report
the effects of transactions to the wallet. Transaction effects contain the updated versions and
digests of any objects used or created in a transaction. By caching these values, wallets can build
transactions without needing to resolve the most recent versions through an API call.

The `@mysten/sui/transaction` SDK exports the `SerialTransactionExecutor` class, which can be used
to build Transaction using an object cache, and has a method to update it's internal cache using the
effects of a transaction.

Using the combination of `sui:signTransaction` and `sui:reportTransactionEffects` dApps can use
whichever API they prefer to execute transactions, querying for whatever data the API exposes
for use in the dapp, and by reporting the effects of the transaction to the wallet, the wallet
should be able to execute transactions without running into issues caused by lagging indexer.
