/// for the address is all held behind a 1-of-N multisig where each authorized user has a key.
/// This would present issues either in the case where the register is
/// compromised (either via a key being exposed or an authorized user leaving the
/// company).
///
/// In either case a new address would need to be created, and customers would
/// then need to understand that they should interact with the new address and
/// not the old (now possibly compomised) one.
///
/// Overall, while it may seem simple it has pretty significant shortcomings
/// that can be overcome with a transfer-to-object  based approach using a
/// shared-object register for tracking authorization.
