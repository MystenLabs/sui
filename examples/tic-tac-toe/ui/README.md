# Tic-Tac-Toe Front-end

This demo app showcases two versions of on-chain tic-tac-toe. One version
utilizes shared objects for coordination between players, while the other uses
owned objects and multi-sigs functionality.

This part of the demo illustrates how to:

- Set-up an application to interact with a blockchain, using the Sui
  TypeScript SDK and dApp-kit, including deploying its Move packages.
- Build UIs that represent on-chain data, and update in response to running
  transactions.
- Interact with multi-sig accounts.
- Using `devInspectTransactionBlock` to run Move code to extract more complex
  state from on-chain.

This dApp was created using `@mysten/create-dapp` that sets up a basic React
Client dApp using the following tools:

- [React](https://react.dev/) as the UI framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for build tooling
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for pre-built UI components
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [`@mysten/dapp-kit`](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) for connecting to
  wallets and loading data
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management

## Starting your dApp

To install dependencies you can run

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start your dApp in development mode run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To build your app for deployment you can run

```bash
pnpm build
```
