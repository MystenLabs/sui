/// An escrow for atomic swap of objects using single-owner transactions that
/// trusts a third party for liveness, but not safety.
///
/// Swap via Escrow proceeds in three phases:
///
/// 1. Both parties `lock` their objects, getting the `Locked` object and a
///    `Key`.  Each party can `unlock` their object, to preserve liveness if the
///    other party stalls before completing the second stage.
///
/// 2. Both parties register an `Escrow` object with the custodian, this
///    requires passing the locked object and its key.  The key is consumed to
///    unlock the object, but its ID is remembered so the custodian can ensure
///    the right objects being swapped.  The custodian is trusted to preserve
///    liveness.
///
/// 3. The custodian swaps the locked objects as long as all conditions are met:
///
///    - The sender of one Escrow is the recipient of the other and vice versa.
///      If this is not true, the custodian has incorrectly paired together this
///      swap.
///
///    - The key of the desired object (`exchange_key`) matches the key the
///      other object was locked with (`escrowed_key`) and vice versa.

///      If this is not true, it means the wrong objects are being swapped,
///      either because the custodian paired the wrong escrows together, or
///      because one of the parties tampered with their object after locking it.
///
///      The key in question is the ID of the `Key` object that unlocked the
///      `Locked` object that the respective objects resided in immediately
///      before being sent to the custodian.
