#![allow(unused)]

//! Types and methods for communication between the package system and external resolvers.
//!
//! External dependencies are resolved in each environment as follows. First, all dependencies are
//! grouped by the resolver name (`<res>`). Then, each binary `<res>` is invoked with the command
//! line `<res> --resolve-deps`; a toml-formatted map of requests is passed to the binary on
//! standard input, and the results are read from standard output.
//!
//! An individual request contains a dependency and an optional environment ID (see [Request]). If
//! the environment ID is not present, the resolver should return the "default" resolution,
//! otherwise it should return the appropriate resolution for the given network.
//!
//! For example, when resolving the following manifest:
//! ```toml
//! [environments]
//! a = "chainID1"
//! b = "chainID2"
//!
//! [dependencies]
//! foo = { r.res1 = "@qux/foo", override = true }
//! bar = { r.res1 = [1,2,3] }
//! xxx = { r.res2 = "zzz" }
//! ```
//!
//! The binaries `res1` and `res2` will each be invoked with `--resolve-deps`
//! (in the case of dep-overrides, they may be invoked more than once). The input for `res1` would
//! be:
//! ```toml
//! flavor = "..."
//!
//! queries.q01 = { argument = "@qux/foo" }
//! queries.q02 = { argument = "@qux/foo", environment-id = "chainID1" }
//! queries.q03 = { argument = "@qux/foo", environment-id = "chainID2" }
//! queries.q04 = { argument = [1,2,3] }
//! queries.q05 = { argument = [1,2,3], environment-id = "chainID1" }
//! queries.q06 = { argument = [1,2,3], environment-id = "chainID2" }
//! ```
//!
//! The resolver will respond with a response for each query (see [Response]). The response is
//! either an array of errors or a successful resolution with a resolved dependency and an optional
//! array of warnings.
//!
//! ```toml
//! responses.q1 = { resolved = { git = "..." }, warnings = ["...", "..."] }
//! responses.q2 = { errors = ["...", "..."] }
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! Anything the resolver prints on stderr will be passed through to this process's standard error
