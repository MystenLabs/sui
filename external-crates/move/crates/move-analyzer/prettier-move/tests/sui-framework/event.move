/// Events module. Defines the `sui::event::emit` function which
/// creates and sends a custom MoveEvent as a part of the effects
/// certificate of the transaction.
///
/// Every MoveEvent has the following properties:
///  - sender
///  - type signature (`T`)
///  - event data (the value of `T`)
///  - timestamp (local to a node)
///  - transaction digest
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// module my::marketplace {
///    use sui::event;
///    /* ... */
///    struct ItemPurchased has copy, drop {
///      item_id: ID, buyer: address
///    }
///    entry fun buy(/* .... */) {
///       /* ... */
///       event::emit(ItemPurchased { item_id: ..., buyer: .... })
///    }
/// }
/// ```
module sui::event {
    /// Emit a custom Move event, sending the data offchain.
    ///
    /// Used for creating custom indexes and tracking onchain
    /// activity in a way that suits a specific application the most.
    ///
    /// The type `T` is the main way to index the event, and can contain
    /// phantom parameters, eg `emit(MyEvent<phantom T>)`.
