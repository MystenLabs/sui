// Checks if module identifiers used during symbolication process at both parsing and typing are the
// same. They are used as a key to a map and if they look differently, it may lead to a crash due to
// keys used for insertion/retrieval being different. There are no actual tests as a potential
// problem would manifest itself in the symbolication algorithm itself.
