Commands:
  build        Build the package at `path`. If no path is provided defaults to current directory
  coverage     Inspect test coverage for this package. A previous test run with the `--coverage` flag must have previously been run
  disassemble  Disassemble the Move bytecode pointed to
  decompile    Decompile Move bytecode into Move source code
  docgen       Generate Rust style documentation for Move packages
  migrate      Migrate to Move 2024 for the package at `path`. If no path is provided defaults to current directory
