Command `build -v`:
Error: Unresolved addresses found. To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of ./Move.toml: e.g.,

[addresses]
std = "0x1"

Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the -d flag

Caused by:
    Unresolved addresses: [
      Named address 'A' in package 'A'
    ]
