error[E07006]: ambiguous usage of variable

   │         Ambiguous usage of variable 'test'
   │         Try an explicit annotation, e.g. 'move test' or 'copy test'
   │
   = Ambiguous inference of 'move' or 'copy' for a borrowed variable's last usage: A 'move' would invalidate the borrowing reference, but a 'copy' might not be the expected implicit behavior since this the last direct usage of the variable.
