error[E02007]: invalid 'fun' declaration
  ┌─ tests/move_2024/expansion/entry_macro.move:3:5
  │
3 │     entry macro fun foo() {}
  │     ^^^^^ ----- Function declared as 'macro' here
  │     │      
  │     Invalid function declaration. It is meaningless for 'macro' functions to be 'entry' since they are fully-expanded inline during compilation
