warning[Lint W99010]: unnecessary `entry` on a `public` function
  ┌─ tests/sui_mode/linter/true_unnecessary_public_entry.move:2:12
  │
2 │     public entry fun true_unnecessary_public_entry() {}
  │            ^^^^^ `entry` on `public` is meaningless. In conjunction with `public`, `entry` adds no additional permissions or restrictions.
  │
  = `public` functions can be called from PTBs. `entry` can be used to allow non-`public` (private or `public(package)`) functions to be called from PTBs, although there will be additional restrictions on the input arguments to such functions.
  = This warning can be suppressed with '#[allow(lint(public_entry))]' applied to the 'module' or module member ('const', 'fun', or 'struct')
