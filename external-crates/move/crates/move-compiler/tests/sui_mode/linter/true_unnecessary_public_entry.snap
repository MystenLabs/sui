warning[Lint W99010]: unnecessary `entry` on a `public` function
  ┌─ tests/sui_mode/linter/true_unnecessary_public_entry.move:2:12
  │
2 │     public entry fun true_unnecessary_public_entry() {}
  │            ^^^^^ `entry` on `public` functions limits composability, as it forces the return value to have `drop` ability. It is only meaningful in niche scenarios.
  │
  = `public` functions can be called from PTBs. As such, `entry` on `public` functions should be used only if you are concerned with the value flow limitations around `entry` functions
  = Unless this function interacts with an intricate set of private `entry` functions, the modifier is likely superfluous
  = This warning can be suppressed with '#[allow(lint(public_entry))]' applied to the 'module' or module member ('const', 'fun', or 'struct')
