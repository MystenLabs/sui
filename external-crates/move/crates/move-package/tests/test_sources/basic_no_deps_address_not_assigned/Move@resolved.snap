Unresolved addresses found. To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of tests/test_sources/basic_no_deps_address_not_assigned/Move.toml: e.g.,

[addresses]
std = "0x1"

Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the -d flag: Unresolved addresses: [
  Named address 'A' in package 'test'
]
