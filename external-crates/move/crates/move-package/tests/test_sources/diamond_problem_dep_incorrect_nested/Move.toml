# Dependency graph and an override (ov) - technically, override in the root is capable of resolving
# a conflict in the sub-graph for A but becase we expect sub-graphs to be correct as standalone
# entities (and our algorithm proceeds by constructing sub-graphs independently), this will result
# in a failure.
