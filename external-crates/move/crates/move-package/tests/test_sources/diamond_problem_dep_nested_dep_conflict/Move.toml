# Dependency graph and an address substitution introduced by an external resolver (C's dependency on
# A and ADep is externally resolved). Even though both C and B rely on the same version of A, in
# the externally resolved graph ADep is reached via a dependency with address substitution whereas
# in internally resolved graph ADep is reached via a dependency without address substitution.
