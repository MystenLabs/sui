# The purpose of this test is to make sure that the dependency graph is correctly read from lock
# files (fast [path) without relying on the information in the manifest files. This is accomplished
# by stripping dependency information from manifest files of packages C and D and expecting that
# reading these dependencies will instead happen from C's and D's lock files. In order to only have
# C's and D's files read and C's and D's manifest files skipped,, C's and D's lock files are updated
# by-hand to contain a manifest digest reflecting the content of the respective stripped manifest
# files.
#
# The Move.locked file is not generated due to how the test harness works but the graph is correctly
# included in the Move.resolved file. Please note that while dependency graph is correct, the
# resolved graph is missing some information as it includes data read from manifest files during
# graph resolution (but NOT during dependency graph construction) that are now stripped.
