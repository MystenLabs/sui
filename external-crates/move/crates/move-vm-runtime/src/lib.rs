/// IDENTIFIER INTERNER
/// The Ientifier Interner is global across Move Runtimes and defined here. This is for two reasons:
/// 1. The interner is _always_ a win compared to non-interned identifiers, which hold their
///    strings in boxes. This is always a strict memory win, in all cases. The overall size of the
///    interner plus its definitions is always going to be smaller than holding those individual
///    identifiers.
/// 2. Different runs will benefit from intern reuse: even if the runtime is discarded, interning
///    is a near-constant cost when spinning up a new runtime. Moreover, the interner can be set to
///    have a maximum memory it will refuse to exceed.
///    TODO: Set up this; `lasso` supports it but we need to expose that interface.
/// 3. If absolutely necessary, the execution layer _can_ dump the interner.
