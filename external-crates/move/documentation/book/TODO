# TODO

## Long term

- Grammar examples aren't readable
- We don't describe the associativity of conditionals or other control flow constructions and {}
- We don't describe identifier rules in a single place
- We don't describe rules for namespaces and uses
- attributes/annotations in general
- describe paths/places more like the compiler thinks about them in 2024
