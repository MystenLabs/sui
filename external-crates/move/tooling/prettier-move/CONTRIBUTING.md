# Contributing

If you decide to contribute to this project, please choose the scope of your contribution (e.g.,
implement formatting for structs) and file an issue in the Sui
[repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) describing the work you plan to do, and wait for a
response from a core team member so that we can avoid duplication of efforts.

Please make sure that the code you add is well documented and that you add relevant tests - please
use existing code as guidance.
