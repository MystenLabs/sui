# Dependency graph and override (ov) - when override is processed there is no entry in the graph
# yet (override is incorrect). This part is the same as in the
# diamond_problem_dep_incorrect_override_empty test. Additionally, a cycle introduced during graph
# construction interferes with part of the algorithm responsible for validating potentially
# incorrect overrides (dependency_graph::override_verify) and if not explicitly handled would
# trigger infinite recursion.
