Files in this directory are more lengthy and specific documentation to go with release notes for a specific release.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific release version, and contains markdown files for longer-form release note associated with that version.

The format for each directory name should follow the template of `<major>_<minor>`
where
  * `<major>` is the major version number
  * `<minor>` is the minor version number

Files under each should be named after the release notes for the feature they are documenting.

E.g., if yoy had a release note for "spline reticulation" as part of version 1.62.0, the path from the `release-notes` directory would be `1_62/spline_reticulation.md`.
