Files in this directory are more lengthy and specific documentation to go with release notes for a specific release.

The format of each file name should follow the temaplate of `v<major>_<minor>_<patch>_<release_note_name>.md`
where
  * `<major>` is the major version number
  * `<minor>` is the minor version number
  * `<patch>` is the patch version number

E.g., if I had a release note for "spline reticulation" as part of version 1.62.0, the file name would be `v1_62_0_spline_reticulation.md`.
