# @mysten/create-dapp

`@mysten/create-dapp` is a CLI tool that helps you create dApp projects.

To get started, run the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npm create @mysten/dapp
```

The console prompts you through creating a new dApp project.

## Templates

When creating a new dApp, you have the following templates to choose from:

- `react-client-dapp`: A basic React dApp that fetches a list of objects the connected wallet owns.
- `react-e2e-counter`: An end-to-end example with Move code and a UI for a simple counter app.

The examples are based off the Vite TypeScript starter project and pre-configured to include the
following:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [`@mysten/dapp-kit`](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit)

These templates are still new. Feedback and suggestions for improvements or future templates are
highly encouraged using issues on GitHub.
