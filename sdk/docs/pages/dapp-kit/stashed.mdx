# Stashed Integration

dApp Kit provides out-of-the-box opt-in support for the [Stashed wallet](../zksend/dapp.mdx).

## Setup

To enable support for Stashed wallets, pass the `stashedWallet` object to the `WalletProvider`
component. This object has the following properties:

- **`name`** - The name of your dApp, shown to the user when connecting to the dApp.
- **`network`** _(optional)_ - The network that you would like the Stashed wallet to use. Defaults
  to `mainnet`, supports `mainnet` and `testnet`.

```tsx
function App({ children }) {
	return (
		<WalletProvider
			stashedWallet={{
				name: 'Your dApp name',
			}}
		>
			{children}
		</WalletProvider>
	);
}
```
