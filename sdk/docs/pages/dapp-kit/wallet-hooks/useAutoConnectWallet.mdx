import { UseAutoConnectionStatusExample } from '../../../examples/wallet-hooks';

# useAutoConnectWallet

The `useAutoConnectWallet` hook retrieves the status for the initial wallet auto-connection process.

```ts
import { ConnectButton, useAutoConnectWallet } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function MyComponent() {
	const autoConnectionStatus = useAutoConnectWallet();

	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton />
			<div>Auto-connection status: {autoConnectionStatus}</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Example

<UseAutoConnectionStatusExample />

## Auto-connection status properties

- `disabled` - When the auto-connection functionality is disabled.
- `idle` - When the initial auto-connection attempt hasn't been made yet.
- `attempted` - When an auto-connection attempt has been made. This means either that there is no
  previously connected wallet, the previously connected wallet was not found, or that it has
  successfully connected to a wallet.
