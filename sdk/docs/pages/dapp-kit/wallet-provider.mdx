# WalletProvider

Use `WalletProvider` to set up the necessary context for your React app. Use it at the root of your
app, so that you can use any of the dApp Kit wallet components underneath it.

```tsx
import { WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function App() {
	return (
		<WalletProvider>
			<YourApp />
		</WalletProvider>
	);
}
```

The `WalletProvider` manages all wallet state for you, and makes the current wallet state available
to other dApp Kit hooks and components.

### Props

All props are optional.

- `preferredWallets` - A list of wallets that are sorted to the top of the wallet list.
- `requiredFeatures` - A list of features that are required for the dApp to function. This filters
  the list of wallets presented to users when selecting a wallet to connect from, ensuring that only
  wallets that meet the dApp requirements can connect.
- `enableUnsafeBurner` - Enables the development-only unsafe burner wallet, useful for testing.
- `autoConnect` - Enables automatically reconnecting to the most recently used wallet account upon
  mounting.
- `zkSend` - Enables and configures the zkSend wallet. Read more about how to
  [use the zkSend integration](./zksend.mdx).
- `storage` - Configures how the most recently connected-to wallet account is stored. Set to `null`
  to disable persisting state entirely. Defaults to using `localStorage` if it is available.
- `storageKey` - The key to use to store the most recently connected wallet account.
- `theme` - The theme to use for styling UI components. Defaults to using the light theme.
