# `WalletProvider`

The `WalletProvider` is used to setup the necessary context for you React application. It should be
at the root of your application, so that you can use any of the Dapp Kit wallet components
underneath it.

```tsx
import { WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function App() {
  return (
    <WalletProvider>
      <YourApp />
    <WalletProvider />
  );
};
```

The `WalletProvider` manages all wallet state for you, and makes the current wallet state available
to other dApp Kit hooks and components.

### Props

All props are optional.

- `preferredWallets` - A list of wallets that are sorted to the top of the wallet list, if they are
- `requiredFeatures` - A list of features that are required for the dApp to function. This filters
  the list of wallets presented to users when selecting a wallet to connect from, ensuring that only
  wallets that meet the dApps requirements can connect.
- `enableUnsafeBurner` - Enables the development-only unsafe burner wallet, which can be useful for
  testing.
- `autoConnect` - Enables automatically reconnecting to the most recently used wallet account upon
  mounting
- `zkSend` - Enables and configures the zkSend wallet.

  to disable persisting state entirely. Defaults to using localStorage if it is available.
