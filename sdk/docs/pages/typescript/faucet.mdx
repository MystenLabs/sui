# Faucet

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

Devnet, Testnet, and local networks include faucets that mint SUI. You can use the Sui TypeScript
SDK to call a network's faucet and provide SUI to the address you provide.

To request SUI from a faucet, import the `requestSuiFromFaucetV0` function from the
`@mysten/sui/faucet` package to your project.

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV0 } from '@mysten/sui/faucet';
```

Use `requestSuiFromFaucetV0` in your TypeScript code to request SUI from the network's faucet.

```typescript
await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
	host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
	recipient: <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>,
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
</Callout>
