# Sui Programmable Transaction Basics

This example starts by constructing a transaction to send SUI. To construct transactions, import the
`Transaction` class and construct it:

```tsx
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions';

const tx = new Transaction();
```

You can then add transactions to the transaction .

```tsx
// create a new coin with balance 100, based on the coins used as gas payment
// you can define any balance here
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [100]);

// transfer the split coin to a specific address
tx.transferObjects([coin], '0xSomeSuiAddress');
```

You can attach multiple transactions of the same type to a transaction, as well. For example, to get
a list of transfers and iterate over them to transfer coins to each of them:

```tsx
interface Transfer {
	to: string;
	amount: number;
}

// procure a list of some Sui transfers to make
const transfers: Transfer[] = getTransfers();

const tx = new Transaction();

// first, split the gas coin into multiple coins
const coins = tx.splitCoins(
	tx.gas,
	transfers.map((transfer) => transfer.amount),
);

// next, create a transfer transaction for each coin
transfers.forEach((transfer, index) => {
	tx.transferObjects([coins[index]], transfer.to);
});
```

After you have the transaction defined, you can directly execute it with a signer using
`signAndExecuteTransaction`.

```tsx
client.signAndExecuteTransaction({ signer: keypair, transaction: tx });
```

## Transactions

Programmable Transactions have two key concepts: inputs and transactions.

Transactions are steps of execution in the transaction. Each Transaction in a Transaction takes a
set of inputs, and produces results. The inputs for a transaction depend on the kind of transaction.
Sui supports following transactions:

- `tx.splitCoins(coin, amounts)` - Creates new coins with the defined amounts, split from the
  provided coin. Returns the coins so that it can be used in subsequent transactions.
  - Example: `tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [100, 200])`
- `tx.mergeCoins(destinationCoin, sourceCoins)` - Merges the sourceCoins into the destinationCoin.
  - Example: `tx.mergeCoins(tx.object(coin1), [tx.object(coin2), tx.object(coin3)])`
- `tx.transferObjects(objects, address)` - Transfers a list of objects to the specified address.
  - Example: `tx.transferObjects([tx.object(thing1), tx.object(thing2)], myAddress)`
- `tx.moveCall({ target, arguments, typeArguments  })` - Executes a Move call. Returns whatever the
  Sui Move call returns.
  - Example:
    `tx.moveCall({ target: '0x2::devnet_nft::mint', arguments: [tx.pure.string(name), tx.pure.string(description), tx.pure.string(image)] })`
- `tx.makeMoveVec({ type, elements })` - Constructs a vector of objects that can be passed into a
  `moveCall`. This is required as there’s no way to define a vector as an input.
  - Example: `tx.makeMoveVec({ elements: [tx.object(id1), tx.object(id2)] })`
- `tx.publish(modules, dependencies)` - Publishes a Move package. Returns the upgrade capability
  object.

## Passing inputs to a transaction

Transaction inputs can be provided in a number of different ways, depending on the transaction, and
the type of value being provided.

#### JavaScript values

For specific transaction arguments (`amounts` in `splitCoins`, and `address` in `transferObjects`)
the expected type is known ahead of time, and you can directly pass raw javascript values when
calling the transaction method. appropriate Move type automatically.

```ts
// the amount to split off the gas coin is provided as a pure javascript number
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [100]);
// the address for the transfer is provided as a pure javascript string
tx.transferObjects([coin], '0xSomeSuiAddress');
```

#### Pure values

When providing inputs that are not on chain objects, the values must be serialized as

[BCS](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/bcs), which can be done using `tx.pure` eg,
`tx.pure.address(address)` or `tx.pure(bcs.vector(bcs.U8).serialize(bytes))`.

`tx.pure` can be called as a function that accepts a SerializedBcs object, or as a namespace that
contains functions for each of the supported types.

```ts
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [tx.pure.u64(100)]);
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [tx.pure(bcs.U64.serialize(100))]);
tx.transferObjects([coin], tx.pure.address('0xSomeSuiAddress'));
tx.transferObjects([coin], tx.pure(bcs.Address.serialize('0xSomeSuiAddress')));
```

To pass `vector` or `option` types, you you can pass use the corresponding methods on `tx.pure`, use
tx.pure as a function with a type argument, or serialize the value before passing it to tx.pure
using the bcs sdk:

```ts
import { bcs } from '@mysten/sui/bcs';

tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::foo::bar',
	arguments: [
		// using vector and option methods
		tx.pure.vector('u8', [1, 2, 3]),
		tx.pure.option('u8', 1),
		tx.pure.option('u8', null),

		// Using pure with type arguments
		tx.pure('vector<u8>', [1, 2, 3]),
		tx.pure('option<u8>', 1),
		tx.pure('option<u8>', null),
		tx.pure('vector<option<u8>>', [1, null, 2]),

		// Using bcs.serialize
		tx.pure(bcs.vector(bcs.U8).serialize([1, 2, 3])),
		tx.pure(bcs.option(bcs.U8).serialize(1)),
		tx.pure(bcs.option(bcs.U8).serialize(null)),
		tx.pure(bcs.vector(bcs.option(bcs.U8)).serialize([1, null, 2])),
	],
});
```

#### Object references

To use an on chain object as a transaction input, you must pass a reference to that object. This can
be done by calling `tx.object` with the object id. Transaction arguments that only accept objects
(like `objects` in `transferObjects`) will automatically treat any provided strings as objects ids.
For methods like `moveCall` that accept both objects and other types, you must explicitly call
`tx.object` to convert the id to an object reference.

```ts
// Object IDs can be passed to some methods like (transferObjects) directly
tx.transferObjects(['0xSomeObject'], 'OxSomeAddress');
// tx.object can be used anywhere an object is accepted
tx.transferObjects([tx.object('0xSomeObject')], 'OxSomeAddress');

tx.moveCall({
	target: '0x2::nft::mint',
	// object IDs must be wrapped in moveCall arguments
	arguments: [tx.object('0xSomeObject')],
});

// tx.object automaically converts the object ID to receiving transaction arguments if the moveCall expects it
tx.moveCall({
	target: '0xSomeAddress::example::receive_object',
	// 0xSomeAddress::example::receive_object expects a receiving argument and has a Move definition that looks like this:
	// public fun receive_object<T: key>(parent_object: &mut ParentObjectType, receiving_object: Receiving<ChildObjectType>) { ... }
	arguments: [tx.object('0xParentObjectID'), tx.object('0xReceivingObjectID')],
});
```

When building a transaction, Sui expects all objects to be fully resolved, including the object
version. The SDK automatically looks up the current version of objects for any provided object
reference when building a transaction. If the object reference is used as a receiving argument to a
`moveCall`, the object reference is automatically converted to a receiving transaction argument.
This greatly simplifies building transactions, but requires additional RPC calls. You can optimize
this process by providing a fully resolved object reference instead:

```ts
// for owned or immutable objects
tx.object(Inputs.ObjectRef({ digest, objectId, version }));

// for shared objects
tx.object(Inputs.SharedObjectRef({ objectId, initialSharedVersion, mutable }));

// for receiving objects
tx.object(Inputs.ReceivingRef({ digest, objectId, version }));
```

#### Transaction results

You can also use the result of a transaction as an argument in a subsequent transactions. Each
transaction method on the transaction builder returns a reference to the transaction result.

```tsx
// split a coin object off of the gas object
const [coin] = tx.splitCoins(tx.gas, [100]);
// transfer the resulting coin object
tx.transferObjects([coin], address);
```

When a transaction returns multiple results, you can access the result at a specific index either
using destructuring, or array indexes.

```tsx
// destructuring (preferred, as it gives you logical local names)
const [nft1, nft2] = tx.moveCall({ target: '0x2::nft::mint_many' });
tx.transferObjects([nft1, nft2], address);

// array indexes
const mintMany = tx.moveCall({ target: '0x2::nft::mint_many' });
tx.transferObjects([mintMany[0], mintMany[1]], address);
```

## Get transaction bytes

If you need the transaction bytes, instead of signing or executing the transaction, you can use the
`build` method on the transaction builder itself.

**Important:** You might need to explicitly call `setSender()` on the transaction to ensure that the
`sender` field is populated. This is normally done by the signer before signing the transaction, but
will not be done automatically if you’re building the transaction bytes yourself.

```tsx
const tx = new Transaction();

// ... add some transactions...

await tx.build({ client });
```

In most cases, building requires your SuiClient to fully resolve input values.

If you have transaction bytes, you can also convert them back into a `Transaction` class:

```tsx
const bytes = getTransactionBytesFromSomewhere();
const tx = Transaction.from(bytes);
```
