# dApp Integration

<Callout type="info">
	If you are using `dapp-kit`, you do not need to install any additional packages to integrate with
	the zkSend wallet. [Read how to integrate with dapp-kit.](../dapp-kit/zksend.mdx)
</Callout>

Using the zkSend SDK, you can allow users to connect to the zkSend wallet from your dApp. The wallet
is provided through the [Wallet Standard](https://docs.sui.io/standards/wallet-standard), and should
appear automatically in your existing wallet connection UI.

## Considerations

- zkSend only supports mainnet at this time.
- Users will only be able to connect their zkLogin wallet from zkSend.
- The zkLogin account will be managed by zkSend, you do not need to set up any OAuth providers.
- You will not get access to the user's private key, you will only be able to connect to the wallet,
  and suggest transactions and messages to sign, just like any other wallet in the ecosystem.

## Setup

To use the zkSend wallet, you will need to register it in your application, using
`registerZkSendWallet`. This only needs to be done once, and should be done as early as possible in
your application's lifecycle.

`registerZkSendWallet` takes two arguments:

- `name`: The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when they are asked to approve the
  connection in zkSend.
- `options`: An optional object with the following properties:
  - `origin`: The origin of the zkSend website. Defaults to `https://zksend.com`.

```ts
import { registerZkSendWallet } from '@mysten/zksend';

registerZkSendWallet('Your dApp Name');
```

## Supported features

The zkSend wallet currently supports the following features:

- `signTransactionBlock`
- `signPersonalMessage`

We intentionally do not support `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock`, and suggest that your dApp instead
use `signTransactionBlock`, and submit the signed transaction within your dApp instead. This
provides better control around execution, and avoids potential issues around data inconsistency. If
you believe you have a strong reason for using `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock`, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose).

## Detecting the zkSend wallet

If you'd like to detect whether the user is connected to the zkSend wallet, you can use the `name`
property on the wallet

For example, if you are using `dapp-kit`, you can use the `useCurrentWallet` hook to get the current
wallet, and check if it is the zkSend wallet.

```ts
import { useCurrentWallet } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { ZKSEND_WALLET_NAME } from '@mysten/zksend';

function ZkSendOnly() {
	const { curentWallet } = useCurrentWallet();
	const walletIsZkSendWallet = curentWallet?.name === ZKSEND_WALLET_NAME;

	// rest of component logic...
}
```
