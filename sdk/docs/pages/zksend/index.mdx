# zkSend SDK

The zkSend SDK provides tools for interacting with the zkSend primitive and the
[Stashed website](https://getstashed.com). It allows dApps to integrate zkSend and Stashed into
their applications by providing a standard wallet interface. It also provides functionality to
create your own zkSend Claim Links, with support for any publicly transferrable asset.
