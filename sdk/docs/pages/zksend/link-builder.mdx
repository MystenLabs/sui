# Creating zkSend Links

<Callout type="warning">
	Products and services that incorporate zkSend links may be subject to financial regulations,
	including obtaining money transmitter licenses in jurisdictions where you provide your services.
	It is the developer's responsibility to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and obtain any
	necessary licenses. The information provided by Mysten Labs is not legal advice, and developers
	should consult with a qualified legal professional to address their specific circumstances.
</Callout>

## Limitations

- zkSend only supports Mainnet at this time.
- Objects within links must be publicly transferrable.

## Create a link

You can start creating your own zkSend link using the `ZkSendLinkBuilder` class. This class
constructor takes an object with the following options:

- **`sender`** (required) - Required. The address of the sender / creator of the link.
- **`redirect`** (optional) - The redirect configuration for the link. See "Claim redirect" below
  for more information.
  - **`url`** - The url to redirect to after the link have been claimed.
  - **`name`** - The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when claiming the link.
- **`client`** (optional) - The `@mysten/sui` client used to fetch data to construct the link. If
  not provided, a default client will be used.

```ts
import { ZkSendLinkBuilder } from '@mysten/zksend';

const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
});
```

#### Adding SUI to the link

You can add SUI to the link by calling `link.addClaimableMist()`. This method takes the following
params:

- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of MIST (the base unit of SUI) to add to the link.

#### Adding non-SUI coins to the link

You can add non-SUI coins to the link by calling `link.addClaimableBalance()`. This method takes the
following params:

- **`coinType`** (required) - The coin type of the coin to add to the link (e.g. `0x2::sui::SUI`).
- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of the coin to add to the link. Represented in the base unit
  of the coin.

The SDK will automatically perform the necessary coin management logic to transfer the defined
amount, such as merging and splitting coin objects.

#### Adding objects to the link

You can add a publicly-transferrable object to the link by calling `link.addClaimableObject()`. This
method takes the following params:

- **`id`** (required) - The ID of the object. This must be owned by the `sender` you configured when
  creating the link.

#### Adding objects created in the same transaction

You can create objects to add to links in the same transaction the link is created in by using
`link.addClaimableObjectRef()`

- **`ref`** (required) - The reference to the object you want to add to the link.
- **`type`** (required) - The move type of the object you are adding

```ts
const tx = new Transaction();

const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
});

const newObject = tx.moveCall({
	target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::your_module::mint`,
});

link.addClaimableObjectRef({
	ref: newObject,
	type: `${PACKAGE_ID}::your_module::YourType`,
});

// Adds the link creation transactions to the transaction
link.createSendTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
});
```

#### Getting the link URL

At any time, you can get the URL for the link by calling `link.getLink()`.

## Submitting the link transaction

Once you have built your zkSend link, you need to execute a transaction to transfer assets and make
the link claimable.

You can call the `link.createSendTransaction()` method, which returns a `Transaction` object that
you can sign and submit to the blockchain.

```ts
const tx = await link.createSendTransaction();

const { bytes, signature } = tx.sign({ client, signer: keypair });

const result = await client.executeTransactionBlock({
	transactionBlock: bytes,
	signature,
});
```

If you have a keypair you would like to send the transaction with, you can use the `create` method
as shorthand for creating the send transaction, signing it, and submitting it to the blockchain.

```ts
await link.create({
	signer: yourKeypair,
});
```

## Claim redirect

You can configure a redirect for the link, which will redirect the user to a URL of your choice
after the link has been claimed. This is useful for dApps that want to use zkSend / Stashed as an
onboarding tool, and have the user redirected to their dApp after claiming the link.

To configure a redirect, you need to provide a `redirect` object when creating the link. This object
takes the following params:

- **`url`** - The URL to redirect to after the link has been claimed.
- **`name`** - The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when claiming the link.

When redirecting to the URL, if the user claims with zkLogin, then Stashed will automatically add a
`stashed_address` query parameter to the URL, containing the Sui address of the user that claimed
the asset. The [Stashed wallet](./dapp.mdx) will automatically read this query parameter, and
consider itself connected as a result of a claim redirect.

```ts
import { ZkSendLinkBuilder } from '@mysten/zksend';

const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
	redirect: {
		url: 'https://your-dapp.com',
		name: 'Your dApp',
	},
});
```

## Claiming a link

To claim a link via the SDK you can use the `ZkSendLink` class:

```ts
import { ZkSendLink } from '@mysten/zksend';

// create a link instance from a URL
const link = await ZkSendLink.fromUrl('https://zksend.com/claim#$abc...');

// list what claimable assets the link has
const { nfts, balances } = link.assets;

// claim all the assets from the link
await link.claimAssets(addressOfClaimer);
```

## Listing links you have created

To list the links created by a specific address, you can use the `listCreatedLinks` function:

```ts
import { listCreatedLinks } from '@mysten/zksend';

const { links, hasNextPage, cursor } = await listCreatedLinks({
	address: addressOfCreator,
});

// get the claimable assets for this link (will be empty if the link has been claimed)
const { nfts, balances } = await links[0].assets;
```

## Listing transactions and the links they created

`getSentTransactionsWithLinks` will return a list of transactions sent by the provided address. Each
result will include the transaction that was sent, along with an array containing any links that
were created or regenerated by that transaction.

```ts
import { getSentTransactionsWithLinks } from '@mysten/zksend';

const { data, hasNextPage, nextCursor } = await getSentTransactionsWithLinks({
	address: addressOfCreator,
});

for (const { transaction, links } of data) {
	// get the claimable assets for this link (will be empty if the link has been claimed)
	const firstLink = links[0];

	// link is claimed
	firstLink.claimed;
	const { nfts, balances } = firstLink.assets;

	// claim link
	await firstLink.link.claimAssets(addressOfClaimer);
}
```

By default `getSentTransactionsWithLinks` will not load the assets for claimed links. This can be
changed by passing `loadClaimedAssets: true` to the function.

```ts
import { getSentTransactionsWithLinks } from '@mysten/zksend';

const { data, hasNextPage, nextCursor } = await getSentTransactionsWithLinks({
	address: addressOfCreator,
	loadClaimedAssets: true,
});
```

## Regenerating links

If you lose a link you've created, you can re-generate the link (this can only done from the address
that originally created the link):

```ts
import { listCreatedLinks } from '@mysten/zksend';

const { links, hasNextPage, cursor } = await listCreatedLinks({
	address: addressOfCreator,
});

// url will be the new link url
const { url, transaction } = await links[0].link.createRegenerateTransaction(addressOfLinkCreator);

// Execute the transaction to regenerate the link
await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction,
	signer: keypair,
});
```

## Bulk link creation

To create multiple links in a single transaction, you can use `ZkSendLinkBuilder.createLinks`:

```ts
const links = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
		client,
		sender: keypair.toSuiAddress(),
	});

	link.addClaimableMist(100n);
	links.push(link);
}

const urls = links.map((link) => link.getLink());

const tx = await ZkSendLinkBuilder.createLinks({
	links,
});

await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({
	transaction: tx,
	signer: keypair,
});
```
