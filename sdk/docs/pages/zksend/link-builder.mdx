# Creating zkSend Links

<Callout type="warning">
	Products and services that incorporate zkSend links may be subject to financial regulations,
	including obtaining money transmitter licenses in jurisdictions where you provide your services.
	It is the developer's responsibility to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and obtain any
	necessary licenses. The information provided by Mysten Labs is not legal advice, and developers
	should consult with a qualified legal professional to address their specific circumstances.
</Callout>

## Limitations

- zkSend only supports mainnet at this time.
- Links must contain gas to claim them. The SDK will automatically determine a gas amount to use,
  and during claiming we will attempt to refund any unused gas to the address that created the link.
- Objects within links must be publically transferrable.

## Create a link

<Callout type="warning">
	zkSend does not keep a record of created links, and losing access to a link will result in the
	loss of funds of any assets contained within this link.
</Callout>

You can start creating your own zkSend link using the `ZkSendLinkBuilder` class. This class
constructor takes an object with the following options:

- **`sender`** (required) - Required. The address of the sender / creator of the link.
- **`redirect`** (optional) - The redirect configuration for the link. See "Claim redirect" below
  for more information.
  - **`url`** - The url to redirect to after the link have been claimed.
  - **`name`** - The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when claiming the link.
- **`client`** (optional) - The `@mysten/sui.js` client used to fetch data to construct the link. If
  not provided, a default client will be used.

```ts
import { ZkSendLinkBuilder } from '@mysten/zksend';

const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
});
```

#### Adding SUI to the link

You can add SUI to the link by calling `link.addClaimableMist()`. This method takes the following
params:

- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of MIST (the base unit of SUI) to add to the link.

#### Adding non-SUI coins to the link

You can add non-SUI coins to the link by calling `link.addClaimableBalance()`. This method takes the
following params:

- **`coinType`** (required) - The coin type of the coin to add to the link (e.g. `0x2::sui::SUI`).
- **`amount`** (required) - The amount of the coin to add to the link. Represented in the base unit
  of the coin.

The SDK will automatically perform the necessary coin management logic to transfer the defined
amount, such as merging and splitting coin objects.

#### Adding objects to the link

You can add a publically-transferrable object to the link by calling `link.addClaimableObject()`.
This method takes the following params:

- **`id`** (required) - The ID of the object. This must be owned by the `sender` you configured when
  creating the link.

#### Getting the link URL

At any time, you can get the URL for the link by calling `link.getLink()`.

## Submitting the link transaction

Once you have built your zkSend link, you need to execute a transaction to transfer assets and make
the link claimable.

You can call the `link.createSendTransaction()` method, which returns a `TransactionBlock` object
that you can sign and submit to the blockchain.

```ts
const txb = await link.createSendTransaction();

const { bytes, signature } = txb.sign({ client, signer: keypair });

const result = await client.executeTransactionBlock({
	transactionBlock: bytes,
	signature,
});
```

If you have a keypair you would like to send the transaction with, you can use the `create` method
as shorthand for creating the send transaction, signing it, and submitting it to the blockchain.

```ts
await link.create({
	signer: yourKeypair,
});
```

## Claim redirect

You can configure a redirect for the link, which will redirect the user to a URL of your choice
after the link has been claimed. This is useful for dApps that want to use zkSend as an onboarding
tool, and have the user redirected to their dApp after claiming the link.

To configure a redirect, you need to provide a `redirect` object when creating the link. This object
takes the following params:

- **`url`** - The URL to redirect to after the link has been claimed.
- **`name`** - The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when claiming the link.

When redirecting to the URL, if the user claims with zkLogin, then zkSend will automatically add a
`zksend_address` query paramter to the URL, containing the Sui address of the user that claimed the
asset. The [zkSend wallet](./dapp.mdx) will automatically read this query parameter, and consider
itself connected as a result of a claim redirect.

```ts
import { ZkSendLinkBuilder } from '@mysten/zksend';

const link = new ZkSendLinkBuilder({
	sender: '0x...',
	redirect: {
		url: 'https://your-dapp.com',
		name: 'Your dApp',
	},
});
```
