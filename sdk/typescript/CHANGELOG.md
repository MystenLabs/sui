### Minor Changes

  If you are using the `subscribeEvent` or `subscribeTransaction` in environments that do not support the `WebSocket` api natively (This will be true for most versions of Node.js) you will need to provide a WebSocket implementation when creating your SuiClient. You can either use a global polyfill for the WebSocket class, or pass a compatible WebSocket implementation into SuiHTTPTransport (eg, using the `ws` package)

  ```typescript
  import { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient, SuiHTTPTransport } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';
  import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

  new SuiClient({
  	transport: new SuiHTTPTransport({
  		url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet'),
  		// The typescript definitions may not match perfectly, casting to never avoids these minor incompatibilities
  		WebSocketConstructor: WebSocket as never,
  	}),
  });
  ```

- 0f06d593a: Added a MultiSigPublicKey class for verifying multisig signatures
- 09f4ed3fc: update signMessage to correctly wrap PersonalMessages before signing
- 6d41059c7: Deprecate imports from the root path which can be imported from a modular export
- cc6441f46: The Sui TS SDK has been broken up into a set of modular exports, and all exports from the root of
  the package have been deprecated. The following export paths have been added:

  - `@mysten/sui.js/client` - A client for interacting with Sui RPC nodes.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/bcs` - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for Sui.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/transaction` - Utilities for building and interacting with transactions.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/keypairs/*` - Modular exports for specific KeyPair implementations.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/verify` - Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/cryptography` - Shared types and classes for cryptography.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/multisig` - Utilities for working with multisig signatures.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/utils` - Utilities for formatting and parsing various Sui types.
  - `@mysten/sui.js/faucet`- Methods for requesting sui from a faucet.

  As part of this refactor we are deprecating a number of existing APIs:

  - `JsonRPCProvider` - This Provider pattern is being replaced by a new `SuiClient`
  - `SignerWithProver` and `RawSigner` - The Concept of Signers is being removed from the SDK. Signing
    in verifying has been moved to the KeyPair classes, and the `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock`
    method has been moved to the new `SuiClient`.
  - The `superstruct` type definitions for types used by JsonRPCProvider are being replaced with
    generated types exported from `@mysten/sui.js/client`. The new type definitions are pure
    typescript types and can't be used for runtime validation. By generating these as types, it will
    be easier to keep them in sync with the RPC definitions and avoid discrepancies between the type
    definitions in the SDK and the data returned by RPC methods.
  - A large number of "getters" are being deprecated. These getters were intended to reduce friction
    caused by rapid iteration in the RPC layer leading up to the mainnet launch. Now that mainnet has
    been launched the RPC API should be more stable, and many of these helpers can be replaced by
    simply accessing the nested properties in the returned data directly.

  The current release should be mostly backwards compatible, and all existing exports will continue to
  be available in this release (with deprecation warnings). With the large number of deprecations
  there may be functionality that should be moved into the new modular version of the SDK. If you find
  there are features that were deprecated without a suitable replacement, we have created a
  [Github Discussion thread](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/discussions/13150) to track those
  use-cases.

  #### Migrating imports

  To migrate imports, you should be able to hover over the deprecated import in the editor of you
  choice, this should provide either the deprecation message letting you know where to import the
  replacement from, or a like "The declaration was marked as deprecated here." with a link to the
  deprecation comment which will tell you how to update your import

  #### Migrating JsonRpcProvider

  The new SuiClient should mostly work as a drop in replacement for the `JsonRpcProvider` provider.
  Setting up a `SuiClient` is slightly different, but once constructed should work just like a
  provider.

  ```diff
  - import { JsonRpcProvider, devnetConnection } from '@mysten/sui.js';
  + import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';

  - const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(localnetConnection);
  + const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet')});
  ```

  #### Signing TransactionBlocks

  Signing and sending transaction blocks has change slightly with the deprecation of the `Signer`
  pattern:

  ```diff
  - import {
  -    Ed25519Keypair,
  -    JsonRpcProvider,
  -    RawSigner,
  -    TransactionBlock,
  -    localnetConnection,
  - } from '@mysten/sui.js';
  + import { Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui.js/keypairs/ed25519';
  + import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';
  + import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui.js/transactions';

    const keypair = new Ed25519Keypair()
  - const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(localnetConnection);
  - const signer = new RawSigner(keyPair, provider);
  + const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet')});

  - const result = await signer.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({
  + const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({
  +   signer: keypair,
      transactionBlock: tx,
      options: { ... }
    })
  ```

  #### Migrating faucet requests

  The ability to request Sui from a faucet was not added to `SuiClient`, instead you will need to use
  a method `@mysten/sui.js/faucet` to make these requests

  ```diff
  - import { JsonRpcProvider, devnetConnection } from '@mysten/sui.js';
  - const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(devnetConnection);
  + import { requestSuiFromFaucetV0, getFaucetHost } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';

  - await provider.requestSuiFromFaucet(
  -  '<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>'
  - );
  + await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
  +   host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
  +   recipient: '<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>',
  +});
  ```

- 001148443: Introduce new `@mysten/sui.js/faucet` export, which should be used for all faucet interactions. This deprecates the previous `requestSuiFromFaucet` APIs that existed on the `JsonRpcProvider` and `Signer` classes.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ea9adb71a: Add multisig support
- 1cfb1c9da3: The `TransactionBlock` builder now uses the protocol config from the chain when constructing and validating transactions, instead of using hard-coded limits. If you wish to perform signing offline (without a provider), you can either define a `protocolConfig` option when building a transaction, or explicitly set `limits`, which will be used instead of the protocol config.
- fb3bb9118a: Remove logging of RPCValidation errors when typescript types do not match RPC response types

- 7659e2e91: Introduce new `Transaction` builder class, and deprecate all existing methods of sending transactions. The new builder class is designed to take full advantage of Programmable Transactions.

- 0d3cb44d9: Change all snake_case field in ts-sdk normalized.ts to camelCase.

- dbe73d5a4: Update `executeTransaction` and `signAndExecuteTransaction` to take in an additional parameter `SuiTransactionBlockResponseOptions` which is used to specify which fields to include in `SuiTransactionBlockResponse` (e.g., transaction, effects, events, etc). By default, only the transaction digest will be included.
- c82e4b454: Introduce BigInt struct to sui-json-rpc-types to serialize and deserialize amounts to/from string. Change ts-sdk to serialize amounts of PaySui and Pay as string.
- 7a2eaf4a3: Changing the SuiObjectResponse struct to use data/error fields instead of details/status

- 0a7b42a6d: This changes almost all occurences of "delegate", "delegation" (and various capitalizations/forms) to their equivalent "stake"-based name. Function names, function argument names, RPC endpoints, Move functions, and object fields have been updated with this new naming convention.
- 3de8de361: Remove `getValidators` API. Use `getLatestSuiSystemState` instead.
- dd348cf03: Refactor `getTransactions` to `queryTransactions`
- 57c17e02a: Removed `JsonRpcProviderWithCache`, use `JsonRpcProvider` instead.
