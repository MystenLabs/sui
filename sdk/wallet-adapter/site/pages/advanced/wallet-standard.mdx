# Wallet Standard

Browser extension wallets built for Sui are defined using the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/). This is a cross-chain standard that defines how wallets can automatically be discovered and interacted with from dApps.

If you are building a wallet, we publish a helper library `@mysten/wallet-standard` which provides types and utilities that make it simple to get started.

### Creating a wallet interface

You need to create a class that represents your wallet. You can use the `Wallet` interface from `@mysten/wallet-standard` to help ensure your class adheres to the standard.

```tsx
import { Wallet, SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
    get version() {
        // Return the version of the Wallet Standard this implements (in this case, 1.0.0).
        return '1.0.0';
    }
    get name() {
        return 'Wallet Name';
    }
    get icon() {
        return 'some-icon-data-url';
    }
    // Return the Sui chains that your wallet supports.
    get chains() {
        return [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN];
    }
}
```

### Implementing features

Features are standard methods consumers can use to interact with a wallet. To be listed in the Sui wallet adapter, you must implement the following features in your wallet:

-   `standard:connect` - Used to initiate a connection to the wallet.
-   `standard:events` - Used to listen for changes that happen within the wallet, such as accounts being added or removed.
-   `sui:signMessage` - Used to prompt the user to sign a personal message, and return the message signature back to the dapp. This can be used to verify the user’s public key.
-   `sui:signTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction block, and return the serialized transaction block and signature back to the dapp. This method does not submit the transaction block for execution.
-   `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` - Used to prompt the user to sign a transaction, then submit it for execution to the blockchain.

You can implement these features in your wallet class under the `features` property:

```tsx
import {
  ConnectFeature,
  ConnectMethod,
  EventsFeature,
  EventsOnMethod,
  SuiFeatures,
  SuiSignMessageMethod,
  SuiSignTransactionBlockMethod,
  SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod
} from "@mysten/wallet-standard";

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
	/* ... existing code from above ... */

  get features(): ConnectFeature & EventsFeature & SuiFeatures {
    return {
      "standard:connect": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        connect: this.#connect,
      },
      "standard:events": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        on: this.#on,
      },
			"sui:signMessage": {
        version: "1.0.0",
				signMessage: this.#signMessage,
			},
      "sui:signTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signTransactionBlock: this.#signTransactionBlock,
      },
      "sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock": {
        version: "1.0.0",
        signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: this.#signAndExecuteTransactionBlock,
      },
    };
  },

  #on: EventsOnMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's events on implementation.
  };

  #connect: ConnectMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's connect implementation
  };

	#signMessage: SuiSignMessageMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signTransactionBlock: SuiSignTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signTransaction implementation
  };

  #signAndExecuteTransactionBlock: SuiSignAndExecuteTransactionBlockMethod = () => {
    // Your wallet's signAndExecuteTransaction implementation
  };
}
```

### Exposing accounts

The last requirement of the wallet interface is to expose an `acccounts` interface. This should expose all of the accounts that a connected dApp has access to. It can be empty prior to initiating a connection through the `standard:connect` feature.

The accounts can use the `ReadonlyWalletAccount` class to easily construct an account matching the required interface.

```tsx
import { ReadonlyWalletAccount } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

class YourWallet implements Wallet {
    get accounts() {
        // Assuming we already have some internal representation of accounts:
        return someWalletAccounts.map(
            (walletAccount) =>
                // Return
                new ReadonlyWalletAccount({
                    address: walletAccount.suiAddress,
                    publicKey: walletAccount.pubkey,
                    // The Sui chains that your wallet supports.
                    chains: [SUI_DEVNET_CHAIN],
                    // The features that this account supports. This can be a subset of the wallet's supported features.
                    // These features must exist on the wallet as well.
                    features: [
                        'sui:signMessage',
                        'sui:signTransactionBlock',
                        'sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock',
                    ],
                })
        );
    }
}
```

### Registering in the window

Once you have a compatible interface for your wallet, you register it using the `registerWallet` function.

```tsx
import { registerWallet } from '@mysten/wallet-standard';

registerWallet(new YourWallet());
```
