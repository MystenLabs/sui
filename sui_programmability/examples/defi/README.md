# DeFi

* FlashLoan: a flash loan is a loan that must be initiated and repaid during the same transaction. This implementation works for any currency type, and is a good illustration of the power of Move [abilities](https://diem.github.io/move/abilities.html) and the "hot potato" design pattern.
* Auction: example implementation of the [English auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction).
* Escrow: an atomic swap leveraging an escrow agent that is trusted for liveness, but not safety (i.e., the agent cannot steal the goods being swapped).
* Uniswap 1.0-style DEX (coming soon).
