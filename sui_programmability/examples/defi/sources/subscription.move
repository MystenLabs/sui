/// This example introduces a `Subscription` type - a `Capability`-like object
/// with a limited number of uses. Once all of them are used, the subscription can
/// be renewed or destroyed.
///
/// Design of this module implies that an application will implement the subscription
/// interface using a `Witness` pattern, while some features are given by default
/// and do not require implementation.
///
///
/// The problem that illustrates usage of this module might be common in Sui. To
/// get to it, we need to provide some background:
///
/// - Shared object transactions in Sui require consensus; and for each shared
/// object there's a sequence of transactions which use / reference it.
///
/// - Mixing multiple shared objects within the same transaction potentially leads
/// to all objects being slowed down depending on how loaded they are.
///
/// - The only way to effectively use multiple shared objects is to be able to call
/// a function in Move which makes use of them. And these actions require `public`
/// function visibility.
///
/// Case in this example is a mocked up liquidity pool implementation with two
/// functions: `swap` - available only directly because of the `entry` visibility
/// and a `dev_swap` - doing the same thing but can be used on chain (ie for
/// cross-chain swaps), and can be used in a function with other shared objects.
///
/// The former is free because this functionality is meant to be available to
/// everyone. While the latter gives additional profits to the liquidity pool by
/// charging extensive (and potentially slowing) usage.
