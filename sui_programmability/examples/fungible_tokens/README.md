# Fungible Tokens

* MANAGED: a token managed by a treasurer trusted for minting and burning. This is how (e.g.) a fiat-backed stablecoin would work.
* BASKET: a synthetic token backed by a basket of other assets. This how (e.g.) a [SDR](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR)-like asset would work.
* FIXED: a token with a fixed supply (coming soon).
* ALGO: a token with an algorithmic issuance policy (coming soon).
