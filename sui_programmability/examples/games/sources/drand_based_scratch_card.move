/// A basic game that depends on randomness from drand (chained mode). See details on how to work with drand in
/// drand_based_lottery.move.
///
/// Anyone can create a new game by depositing X*100 SUIs as a reward, and setting the current drand round as the base
/// round. This creates two objects:
/// - Game - an immutable object that includes all parameters to be used when buying tickets.
/// - Reward - a shared object that holds the reward. It can be withdrawn by any winner ("first come, first served").
///   If not withdrawn within a few epochs, can be returned to the game creator.
///
/// A user who wishes to play game G should:
/// - Check if G.epoch is the current epoch, and that G.base_drand_round + 24h is in the future.
///   See drand_based_lottery.move for how to calculate a round for a given point in time.
/// - Check that the relevant reward is still non negative.
/// - Call buy_ticket() with the right amount of SUI.
/// - Wait until the relevant drand round's randomness is available, and can call evaluate().
/// - If received an object Winner, claim the reward using take_reward().
///
/// Important: There is 1 reward per game, and there is no limit on the number of tickets that can be bought for a
/// a single game. *Only* the winner of a game who called take_reward first will receive a reward.
/// One may extend this game and add another round in which winners can register their winner tickets, and then one of
/// the winners is chosen at random. This part, however, will require using a shared object.
