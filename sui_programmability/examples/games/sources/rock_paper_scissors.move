// This is an idea of a module which will allow some asset to be
// won by playing a rock-paper-scissors (then lizard-spoke) game.
//
// Initial implementation implies so-called commit-reveal scheme
// in which players first submit their commitments
// and then reveal the data that led to these commitments. The
// data is then being verified by one of the parties or a third
// party (depends on implementation and security measures).
//
// In this specific example, the flow is:
//   1. User A creates a Game struct, where he puts a prize asset
//   2. Both users B and C submit their hashes to the game as their
// guesses but don't reveal the actual values yet
//   3. Users B and C submit their salts, so the user A
// can see and prove that the values match, and decides who won the
// round. Asset is then released to the winner or to the game owner
// if nobody won.
//
// TODO:
// - Error codes
// - Status checks
// - If player never revealed the secret
// - If game owner never took or revealed the results (incentives?)
