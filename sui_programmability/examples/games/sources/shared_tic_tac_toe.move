// This is a rewrite of TicTacToe using a completely different approach.
// In TicTacToe, since the game object is owned by the admin, the players are not
// able to directly mutate the gameboard. Hence each marker placement takes
// two transactions.
// In this implementation, we make the game object a shared object.
// Both players have access and can mutate the game object, and hence they
// can place markers directly in one transaction.
// In general, using shared object has an extra cost due to the fact
// that Sui needs to sequence the operations that mutate the shared object from
// different transactions. In this case however, since it is expected for players
// to take turns to place the marker, there won't be a significant overhead in practice.
// As we can see, by using shared object, the implementation is much
// simpler than the other implementation.
