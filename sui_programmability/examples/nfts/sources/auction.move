///  This module is an implementation of an English auction
///  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction) using single-owner
///  objects only. There are three types of parties participating in an
///  auction:
///  - auctioneer - a trusted party that runs the auction
///  - owner - the original owner of an item that is sold at an
///    auction; the owner submits a request to an auctioneer which runs
///    the auction
///  - bidders - parties interested in purchasing items sold
///    at an auction; they submit bids to an auctioneer to affect the
///    state of an auction
///
///  A typical lifetime of an auction looks as follows:
///  - The auction starts with the owner sending an item to be sold along with
///    its own address to the auctioneer who creates and initializes an
///    auction.
///  - Bidders send their bid to the auctioneer.
///    A bid consists of the funds offered for the item and the bidder's address.
///  - The auctioneer periodically inspects the bids:
///    - (inspected bid > current best bid (initially there is no bid)):
///      The auctioneer updates the auction with the current bid
///      and the funds of the previous highest bid are sent back to their owner.
///    - (inspected bid <= current best bid):
///      The auctioneer sents the inspected bid's funds back to the new bidder,
///      and the auction remains unchanged.
///  - The auctioneer eventually ends the auction:
///    - if no bids were received, the item goes back to the original owner
///    - otherwise the funds accumulated in the auction go to the
///      original owner and the item goes to the bidder that won the auction
