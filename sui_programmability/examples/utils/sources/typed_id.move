/// when storing its ID in another object.

/// For example
/// ```
/// struct MyObject has key {
///   id: VersionedID,
///   child1: TypedID<A>,
///   child2: TypedID<B>,
/// }
/// ```
/// We then know that `child1` is an ID for an object of type `A` and that `child2` is an `ID`
/// of an object of type `B`
