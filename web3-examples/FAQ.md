### Can I use these examples in production?

These examples are educational and should be audited before production use. Always:
- Get professional security audits
- Run comprehensive tests
- Use testnetsthen first
- Follow best practices

### Which blockchain should I start with?

**Beginners**: Start with Ethereum (Solidity) - largest ecosystem
**Performance**: Try Solana (Rust) - high throughput
**Innovation**: Explore Sui/Aptos (Move) - modern design

### How do I run the examples?

Each example has its own README with setup instructions. Generally:
1. Install dependencies
2. Compile/build
3. Run tests
4. Deploy (testnet first)

## Development Questions

### How do I contribute?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### What if I find a bug?

Open an issue with:
- Description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details

### Can I add a new language?

Yes! We welcome new language examples. Follow the existing structure and include:
- Working code examples
- Comprehensive README
- Tests (if applicable)
- Documentation

## Blockchain-Specific Questions

### How do I get test tokens?

- **Ethereum Goerli**: [goerlifaucet.com](https://goerlifaucet.com)
- **Solana Devnet**: `solana airdrop 2`
- **NEAR Testnet**: [NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)
- **Sui Devnet**: `sui client faucet`

### What RPC endpoints should I use?

**Public (Development)**:
- Ethereum: https://eth.llamarpc.com
- Polygon: https://polygon-rpc.com
- Solana: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

**Production**: Use your own node or paid RPC services (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)

### How much does deployment cost?

Costs vary by network:
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: $50-500+ (high gas)
- **Polygon**: $0.01-1 (low gas)
- **Solana**: <$1 (very cheap)
- **Testnets**: Free!

## Security Questions

### How do I keep my private keys safe?

- Never commit to version control
- Use environment variables
- Use hardware wallets for production
- Keep backups in secure locations

### Are these contracts audited?

No, these are educational examples. Get professional audits before mainnet deployment.

### What about smart contract vulnerabilities?

We follow best practices but recommend:
- Security audits
- Formal verification
- Bug bounties
- Insurance
